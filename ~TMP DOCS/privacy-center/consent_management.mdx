# Manage Consent in the Privacy Center

The Fides Privacy Center provides configurable consent settings for regulatory compliance, allowing users to access and edit their data use preferences. 

To learn more about configuring your Privacy Center for DSR enforcement, see the [Privacy Center guide](/guides/privacy-center).

## Configuration

The Fides Privacy Center's text and actions are managed by a `config.json` file, which should be located in your project’s `/clients/app/config` directory. More information on configuration options can be found in the [Privacy Center guide](/guides/privacy-center).
