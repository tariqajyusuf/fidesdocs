## Introduction
In this tutorial, you'll learn how to reject privacy requests in Fides Control and provide a reason for the decision to ensure consistent record keeping and to communicate to the subject.

## Prerequisites

For this tutorial, you'll need:

* A Fides Cloud or Fides Enterprise account
* The role of either `Owner`, `View & Approver` or `Approver` to manage privacy requests.
* At least one system integration configured for privacy requests. Read how to [configure an integration](/tutorials/privacy-requests/privacy-requests-configuration/integrations).
* A privacy center to receive and process privacy requests. Read how to [configure a privacy center](/tutorials/consent-management/consent-management-configuration/privacy-experiences/privacy-center).



## Rejecting a Privacy Request
A privacy request can be rejected from the privacy request administration page or from the privacy request details page. 

To reject a request on the administration page, hover over the kebab menu `...` for the request and click **Deny** as shown:

## Recording a Reason for Rejection

When rejecting a privacy request, you'll be prompted to provide a reason for rejecting the request. The reason for rejecting the request is stored in the Fides audit trail for reporting purposes and also communicated to the subject via email.
