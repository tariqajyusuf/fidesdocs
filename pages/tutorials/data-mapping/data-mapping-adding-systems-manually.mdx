# Data Mapping: Adding Systems Manually

<TutorialKey duration="4" product="Fides" topic="Data Mapping" video="true" interactive="true"/>

<Callout emoji=""> This tutorial requires Fides Cloud or Fides Enterprise. For more information, [talk to our solutions team.](https://ethyca.com/book-demo?utm_source=docs-site) </Callout>

## Introduction
In this tutorial, you'll add a new system manually to your data map. By the end of this tutorial, you'll understand systems and data maps, and how to manage them in Fides.

## Prerequisites

For this tutorial you will need:

* A Fides Cloud or Fides Enterprise account
* The role of `Owner` or `Contributor` for your Fides organization.

## Adding systems manually

To start, navigate to **Data map** â†’ **Add systems** and choose **Add a system** to add a system manually.

### Complete your system's information

<Callout emoji="" type="info">If you're a Fides Enterprise customer, you can use our built-in privacy dictionary, Fides Compass, to pre-populate system info and data use information. Learn more at [Fides Privacy Dictionary](/tutorials/data-mapping/data-mapping-dictionary)</Callout>

Create your system by completing the required **System details** on the **System information** tab as follows:

#### System details

* **Name***:  A unique and relevant name to identify the system on the data map and in reports.
* **Unique ID**: A unique identifier for the system that is automatically generated based on the system's name.
* **Description**: An optional description to help other users understand what this system does. 
* **System tags**: Optional tags you might want to associate with your system for grouping and search purposes.

#### System dataset references
A dataset reference is a link to a [dataset configuration](/dev-docs/datasets) that will typically describe the schema of a data store, often including annotations for data categories. When datasets are referenced by a system, the categories annotated in the dataset will appear in the data map and be available for reporting.

#### Cookie properties
In this section, information is stored about how this system uses cookies.
* **This system uses cookies**: used to indicate that the system uses cookies
* **This system refreshes cookies**: used to indicate that the system automatically refreshes cookies. 
* **This system uses non-cookie trackers**: used to indicate that the system uses tracking methods other than cookies.
* **Maximum duration (seconds)**: the maximum lifespan of a cookie, measured in seconds.

#### Data processing properties
In this section, declarations are made to determine which other fields will likely need to be completed for compliance purposes.
* **This system processes personal data***: used to indicate that the system processes or stores personal data. 
* **This system is exempt from privacy regulations***: shown for systems that process personal data.

<Callout emoji="" type="info">If the system does not process personal data OR the system is exempt from privacy regulations, then the remaining fields do not appear.</Callout>

* **This system performs profiling**: used to indicate that the system uses automated profiling that has legal effects.
* **Legal basis for profiling**: the legal basis for automated profiling. Required for systems that perform profiling.
* **This system transfers data**: used to indicate that the system transfers data to other countries or international organizations. 
* **Legal basis for transfer**: the legal basis for international transfer. Required for systems that transfer data internationally.
* **This system requires data privacy assessments**: used to indicate that the system requires a Data Protection Assessement (DPA) or a Data Protection Impact Assessement (DPIA).
* **DPIA/DPA location**: a link or description of where the assessment is located.
