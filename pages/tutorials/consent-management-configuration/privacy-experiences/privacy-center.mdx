# Consent Management: Configuring the Privacy Center Experience

<TutorialKey duration="5" product="Fides" topic="Consent Management"/>

In this tutorial, we'll configure the privacy center experience. 

After reading this, you'll be familiar with the configurable options of the privacy center and how they're presented to your visitors.

## Prerequisites

For this tutorial you'll need:

* A Fides Cloud or Fides Enterprise account
* The role of `Owner` or `Contributor` for your Fides organization.
* At least one system with a data use on your Data Map. Read how to [add systems to the Data Map](/tutorials/data-mapping-adding-systems-manually) now.
* At least one privacy notice configured. Read how to [configure privacy notices](/tutorials/privacy-experiences/privacy-notices) now.



## Configuring the Privacy Center Experience
To start, navigate to **Privacy requests** → **Consent** → **Privacy experiences** where you'll see a list of currently configured privacy experiences for your Fides account.

Click on the **Privacy center** component to view the detailed configuration page.

From here, you can set the two components of the privacy center experience:
1. **[Consent Page Text](#consent-page-text)**: the text information displayed to the user at the top of the consent management section of the privacy center.
2. **[Actions](#actions)**: the labels for the buttons presented to the user in the privacy center.

Let's review each privacy center experience configuration component:

### Consent Page Text
The consent page text is the information shown to your visitor in the privacy center experience.

As shown in the screenshot below, you can configure:
* **Title**: the title of the privacy center consent page displayed to the visitor.
* **Description**: the detailed text of the privacy center displayed to the visitor.
