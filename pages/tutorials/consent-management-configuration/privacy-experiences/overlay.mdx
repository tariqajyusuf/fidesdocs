# Consent Management: Configuring the Overlay Privacy Experience

<TutorialKey duration="5" product="Fides" topic="Consent Management"/>

In this tutorial, we'll configure the overlay privacy experience comprised of a banner and preference pop-up.

After reading this, you'll be with the configurable options of the overlay and preference pop-up.

## Prerequisites

For this tutorial you'll need:

* A Fides Cloud or Fides Enterprise account
* The role of `Owner` or `Contributor` for your Fides organization.
* At least one system with a data use on your Data Map. Read how to [add systems to the Data Map](/tutorials/data-mapping-adding-systems-manually) now.
* At least one privacy notice configured. Read how to [configure privacy notices](/tutorials/consent-management-configuration/privacy-notices) now.



## Configuring the Overlay Experience
To start, navigate to **Privacy requests** → **Consent** → **Privacy experiences** where you will see a list of currently configured privacy experiences for your Fides account.

Click on the **Overlay** component to view the detailed configuration page.

From here you can set the three components of the privacy center experience:
1. **[Banner and Preference Text](#banner-and-preference-text)**: the text information displayed to the user on both the banner and in the preference pop-up.
2. **[Actions](#actions)**: the labels for the buttons presented to the user in on both the banner and in the preference pop-up.
32 **[Privacy Policy](#privacy-policy)**: the label for the privacy policy and link to the privacy policy.

Let's review each banner and preference pop-up configuration component:

### Banner and Preference Text
The banner and preference text is the information shown to your visitor in the banner and preference pop-up experience.

As shown in the screenshot below, you can configure:
* **Banner title**: the title displayed to the user in both the banner and the pop-up experience.
* **Banner description**: the description displayed to the user in both the banner and the pop-up experience.

You can configure:

* **Reject button label**: the label to reject the privacy notice.
* **Preferences button label**: the label to open the preferences pop-up.
