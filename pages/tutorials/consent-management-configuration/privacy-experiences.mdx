# Consent Management: Configuring Privacy Experiences

<TutorialKey duration="5" product="Fides" topic="Consent Management"/>

<Callout emoji=""> This tutorial requires Fides Cloud or Fides Enterprise. For more information, [talk to our solutions team.](https://ethyca.com/book-demo?utm_source=docs-site) </Callout>

In this tutorial, we'll review privacy experiences, how they're configured, and how they're presented to visitors.

After reading this, you'll be familiar with how to configure privacy experiences and how privacy notices are presented within your privacy experiences to visitors based on their location.

## Prerequisites

For this tutorial you'll need:

* A Fides Cloud or Fides Enterprise account
* The role of `Owner` or `Contributor` for your Fides organization.
* At least one system with a data use on your Data Map. Read how to [add systems to the Data Map](/tutorials/data-mapping-adding-systems-manually) now.
* At least one privacy notice configured. Read how to [configure privacy notices](/tutorials/consent-management-fundamentals/consent-management-privacy-notices) now.



## What are Privacy Experiences?

A privacy experience in Fides is the user experience for how privacy notices are presented to a visitor based on the regulations that apply in the user's location.

Fides has two default privacy experiences, the **Overlay** and accompanying pop-up and the **Privacy Center**. Learn about [privacy experience fundamentals](/tutorials/consent-management-fundamentals/consent-management-privacy-experiences) here.

## Viewing Privacy Experiences
To view privacy experiences in Fides, navigate to **Privacy requests** → **Consent** → **Privacy experiences** where you'll see a list of currently configured privacy experiences for your Fides account.

Each item on the list of privacy experiences consists of a location, component type, date of last update, and a toggle to enable it. 

* **Locations**: the locations this privacy experience will be displayed.
* **Component**: the type of privacy user experience.
* **Last update**: the last time the privacy experience was modified.
* **Enable**: a toggle to activate to deactivate the privacy experience. An inactive experience is not displayed to any visitor.

## Available Privacy Experiences
Fides has two default privacy experiences you can configure:
1. **Privacy Center**: a privacy center typically available at `https://privacy.your-brand.com`.
2. **Overlay**: a banner and pop-up commonly used for opt-in cookie consent.

## Configuring the Privacy Center Experience
Click on the **Privacy center** component to view the detailed configuration page.

From here you can set the two components of the privacy center experience:
1. **Consent Page Text**: the text information displayed to the user at the top of the consent management section of the privacy center.
2. **Actions**: the labels for the buttons presented to the user in the privacy center.

Let's review each privacy center experience configuration component:

### Consent Page Text
The consent page text is the information shown to your visitor in the privacy center experience.

As shown in the screenshot below, you can configure:
* **Title**: the title of the privacy center consent page displayed to the visitor.
* **Description**: the detailed text of the privacy center displayed to the visitor.
