# Consent Management: Install Fides JS on your Website

<TutorialKey duration="10" product="Fides" topic="Consent Management"/>

In this tutorial we will install Fides JS, the Fides JavaScript Components, to your website so that your visitors are served the appropriate privacy and consent notices.

After reading this, you'll be familiar with how to add `Fides.js` to your website.

## Prerequisites

For this tutorial you'll need:

* A Fides Cloud or Fides Enterprise account
* The role of `Owner` or `Contributor` for your Fides organization.
* Access to the source code of your website to add JavaScript.
* At least one system with a data use on your Data Map. Read how to [add systems to the Data Map](/tutorials/data-mapping-adding-systems-manually) now.
* At least one privacy notice configured. Read how to [configure privacy notices](privacy-notices) now.
* At least one privacy experience configured. Read how to [configure privacy experiences](privacy-experiences) now.



## Install Fides.js Script on your Website

`Fides.js` is the JavaScript package that powers Fides privacy and consent experiences on your website. To install `fides.js`, first get the `fides` script from your Fides installation. 

To do this, navigate to the Privacy Experiences by going to **Privacy requests** → **Consent** → **Privacy experiences** where you will see a list of currently configured privacy experiences. 

Click the button labeled **Get JavaScript tag** to reveal the `fides` script tags for your Fides installation as shown below:

The Fides script tags are typically in the format:

```javascript filename="Fides.js Script Tags"
<head>
  <!-- Include before any scripts which need consent. -->
  <script src="{{PRIVACY_CENTER_URL}}/fides.js"></script>
</head>
```

Replace `{{PRIVACY_CENTER_URL}}` with the URL of your privacy center, such as `https://privacy.your-brand.com`.

##### Installation Location
It's important that Fides.js is loaded as early as possible on your site. For this reason, it's recommended to place these tags ahead of all other JavaScript in the `<head>` of your website.

## Integrating Fides.js with Google Tag Manager

When using Google Tag Manager, calling `fides.gtm()` will ensure any consent choices made by a site visitor are added to the GTM Data Layer under a variable named `fides.consent`.

To enable the Google Tag Manager integration, call `Fides.gtm()` in your website code, similar to the following:

```javascript filename="Fides.js for Google Tag Manager"
<head>
  <script src="https://privacy.example.com/fides.js"></script>
  <script>Fides.gtm()</script>

  <!-- Include Google Tag Manager's script below. -->
<head>
```

## Integrating Fides.js with Custom JavaScript

For tags that are managed outside of a Tag Manager, or any other custom code which requires user consent, you can check the user’s consent directly in the `Fides.consent` global variable.

For example, to check for an explicit opt-out from a user you can do the following:

```javascript filename="Fides.js for Custom JavaScript"
if (Fides && !Fides.consent.data_sales_and_sharing) {
  // User has opted out
} else {
  // User has not opted out
}
```

Note that, in the above example, `data_sales_and_sharing` matches a cookie key for a privacy notice created when configuring consent management in Fides Control. The cookie key can be any unique identifier you choose when creating a privacy notice. 

Read about [creating cookie keys as part of privacy notices](privacy-notices#cookie-key) here.
