# Privacy Requests: Configuring Integrations

<TutorialKey duration="10" product="Fides" topic="Privacy Requests" interactive="true"/>

## Introduction
In this tutorial, you'll add and configure a privacy request integration for a system on the [Data Map.](/tutorials/data-mapping-get-started) By the end of this tutorial, you'll understand the relationship between systems and integrations as well as how to connect, configure, and test an integration.

## Prerequisites

For this tutorial you will need:

* A Fides Cloud or Fides Enterprise account
* The role of `Owner` or `Contributor` for your Fides organization.
* At least one system on your Data Map. Read how to [add systems to the Data Map](/tutorials/data-mapping-adding-systems-manually) now.
* Credentials for the system you intend to integrate for privacy requests.



## Configuring a System Integration

Integrations are used to securely connect to systems and process privacy requests. 

Typically, these are API integrations to allow you to simplify and automate each request. For systems that do not have APIs and only accept privacy requests by email, Fides has an integration to automate email notifications to the vendor. 

To start, navigate to **Data map** â†’ **View systems** to view a list of your current systems. 

### Select a System to Edit

From here, you can search for the system you want to edit, or select directly from the list. 

To edit click the Kebab `...` menu and select **Edit** as shown below:

### View the System Integrations Tab

From the System Information tab, navigate to the Integrations tab as shown below:

### Select the Integration to Configure
On the System Integrations tab select the **Connection Type** dropdown and search for the integration you would like to add for the selected system.

### Configure the Integration

Every integration requires the following fields to be configured:

* <span class="nx-absolute -nx-mt-20" id="integration-name"></span>**Integration Name** - The name of the integration being configured.
* <span class="nx-absolute -nx-mt-20" id="integration-description"></span>**Integration Description** - A description of the integration being configured.
* <span class="nx-absolute -nx-mt-20" id="connection-identifier"></span>**Connection Identifier** - A unique key to identify the integration within Fides.

In addition to these common fields, each integration requires credential information specific to that system's authentication requirements.

The example below shows the different credentials required for Hubspot and Gorgias.

Upon providing the integration credentials, **Save** your integration settings.

### Test the Integration

Once your integration credentials are saved, you can verify the credentials are working by clicking **Test connection**.
If the integration is working correctly, you will be presented with a `Test succeeded` message like the one shown below:

This example used the Hubspot integration. For a complete list of integrations and instructions on generating credentials, visit the [integration registry](/dev-docs/configuration/integrations).
