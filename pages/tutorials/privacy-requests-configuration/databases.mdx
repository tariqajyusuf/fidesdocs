# Privacy Requests: Configuring Databases

<TutorialKey duration="10" product="Fides" topic="Privacy Requests" interactive="true"/>

## Introduction
In this tutorial, you'll configure a privacy request integration for a database. By the end of this tutorial, you'll understand the relationship between systems, integrations, datasets, and databases as well as how to connect, configure and test an integration.

## Prerequisites

For this tutorial you will need:

* A Fides Cloud or Fides Enterprise account
* The role of `Owner` or `Contributor` for your Fides organization.
* At least one system on your Data Map. Read how to [add systems to the Data Map](/tutorials/data-mapping-adding-systems-manually) now.
* Connection information and credentials for the database you intend to integrate for privacy requests.



## Integrating Privacy Requests to Databases
In order to securely connect to a database and process privacy requests, Fides requires credentials to the database and a schema labeled with the personal information in the system. 

In Fides, a database schema is referred to as a dataset. Read about [creating and maintaining datasets in Fides](/user-guides/datasets/generate-datasets) here.

## Configuring a Database Integration

To start, navigate to **Data map** â†’ **View systems** to view a list of your current systems. 

If you have not already added your database to Fides, read how to [add systems to the Data Map](/tutorials/data-mapping-adding-systems-manually) now.

### Select a System to Edit

From here you can search for the system you want to edit, or select directly from the list. 

To edit click the Kebab `...` menu and select **Edit** as shown below:

### View the System Integrations Tab

From the System Information tab, navigate to the Integrations tab as shown below:

### Select the Integration to Configure
On the System Integrations tab select the **Connection Type** dropdown and search for the integration you'd like to add for the selected system.

### Configure the Database Integration

Every database integration requires the following fields to be configured:

* <span class="nx-absolute -nx-mt-20" id="integration-name"></span>**Integration Name** - The name of the database integration being configured.
* <span class="nx-absolute -nx-mt-20" id="integration-description"></span>**Integration Description** - A description of the database integration being configured.
* <span class="nx-absolute -nx-mt-20" id="connection-identifier"></span>**Connection Identifier**- A unique key to identify the database integration within Fides.

In addition to these common fields, every database type requires distinct connection and credential information. 

The example below shows the credentials required for PostgreSQL:

### Selecting a Dataset

To execute privacy requests on a database, Fides requires a schema of labeled personal data known as a Fides dataset. Read about [creating and maintaining datasets in Fides](/user-guides/datasets/generate-datasets) here.

Select the dataset for the database being configured from the available list of datasets:

<Screenshot img="/assets/img/tutorials/privacy-requests-select-dataset.gif" description="Select the dataset associated with the database"  mw="450" />

When you've provided all database connection information, including a dataset, **Save** your integration settings.

### Test the Integration

Once your integration credentials are saved, you can verify the credentials are working by clicking **Test connection**.
If the integration is working correctly, you will be presented with a `Test succeeded` message.

This example used the PostgreSQL integration, for a complete list of integrations and instructions, visit the [integration registry](/dev-docs/configuration/integrations).
