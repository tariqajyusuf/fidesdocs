# Data Mapping: Data Use & Processing Activities

<TutorialKey duration="9" product="Fides" topic="Data Mapping" video="true" interactive="true"/>

## Introduction

In this tutorial, you'll add your system's privacy activities and by the end of this tutorial, you'll be able to update and manage your system's privacy and processing activities for reporting.

## Prerequisites

For this tutorial you will need:

* A Fides Cloud or Fides Enterprise account
* The role of `Owner` or `Contributor` for your Fides organization.



## Adding data uses and processing activities

Once you’ve inventoried your system and it's available on the data map, you *must* complete the system privacy activities information that will enable you to report on compliance, identify risks, and assist with processing privacy requests.

To add a data use, provide the following information. Note that a system may have multiple data uses. Think of this as the various purposes for which you process data in the system:

* <span class="nx-absolute -nx-mt-20" id="portal-data-use"></span>[Data Use](#portal-data-use) - A data use from the Fides taxonomy that represents what you are using the data for in the system.
* <span class="nx-absolute -nx-mt-20" id="portal-processing-activity"></span>[Processing Activity](#portal-processing-activity) - A more detailed description of the use of the data; this is often used for reporting purposes.
* <span class="nx-absolute -nx-mt-20" id="portal-data-categories"></span>[Data Categories](#portal-data-categories) - The categories of personal data being processed by this activity.
* <span class="nx-absolute -nx-mt-20" id="portal-data-subjects"></span>[Data Subjects](#portal-data-subjects) - The types of user data being processed by this activity.
* <span class="nx-absolute -nx-mt-20" id="portal-dataset-references"></span>[Dataset References](#portal-dataset-references) - An optional reference to a dataset contained in this system involved in this activity. For more information about Datasets read the [Guide to Datasets in Fides](#LINK).

There are three methods to add or update privacy related information for your systems on your data map:

1. [During manual system creation](#adding-system-privacy-information-during-system-creation)
2. [From the system management portal](#editing-system-privacy-information-from-the-system-portal)
3. [From the data map system tray](#editing-system-privacy-information-from-the-system-tray)

### Adding system privacy information during system creation
To add privacy information after creating a system manually, select the **Data uses** tab, from here you can add a **Data use** selecting the **Add a Data Use+** button.

### Editing system privacy information from the system portal
To edit a system, navigate to **Data map** → **View systems** where you can search existing systems. Click the kebab menu ```...``` for your chosen system and click **Edit**.

On the system portal page, select the **Data uses** tab, from here you can add or edit a **Data use** by either clicking on an existing Data use or the **Add a Data Use+** button.

### Editing system privacy information from the system tray

To edit a system, navigate to **Data map**, you can browse the Data map in **Map** or **Table** view. The example below uses the table view.
Select the system you are updating to see the **System tray**. 

From the System tray you can add or edit a **Data use** by either clicking on an existing Data use or the **Add a Data Use+** button.

Next you will learn to visualize, filter and build reports such as a RoPA (Record of Processing Activities).
