# Privacy Requests: Submitting Requests

<TutorialKey duration="4" product="Fides" topic="Privacy Requests" interactive="true"/>

## Introduction
In this tutorial you'll learn how your users can submit privacy requests.  You'll cover the process for a subject to submit their request on the privacy center, verify their identity and receive the request.

## Prerequisites

For this tutorial you will need:

* A Fides Cloud or Fides Enterprise account
* The role of either `Owner`, `View & Approver` or `Approver` to manage privacy requests.
* At least one system integration configured for privacy requests. Read how to [configure an integration](../privacy-requests-configuration/privacy-requests-configure-integrations).
* A privacy center to receive and process privacy requests. Read how to [configure a privacy center](#LINK).

You should also be familiar with the basics of [Fides Control](#LINK).


## Submitting a Privacy Request

Fides provides a pre-built privacy center for your subjects to submit privacy requests. Read about [configuring your privacy center](#LINK) here.

Typically your privacy center is configured to be available on a subdomain of your brand website, such as: `https://privacy.your-brand.com`.

The example below shows a sample privacy center for the "Cookie House" sample project.

To submit a privacy request the subject must provide an identifier, such as their email address or phone number as shown in the example below:

## Subject Identity Verification
With subject identity verification enabled, when the subject submits their privacy request, they will receive a code to their email address or phone number to confirm their identity. 

Below is an example of the email received for the "Cookie House" sample project.

The subject provides the code when prompted on the privacy center to verify their identity as shown below:

You can configure whether you would like to have identity verification on your privacy center. Read about [configuring identity verification](#LINK) here.

Next we'll look at how to review and approve privacy requests.
