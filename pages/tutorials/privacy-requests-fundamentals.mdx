## Common Privacy Request Rights
The rights for privacy requests afforded to a user are typically the following:

| Right                                 | Description                                                                                                               |
| :------------------------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	|
| **Access**    						| Access the personal data collected and processed about the user and understand what purposes it was used for.          |
| **Erasure**    						| Delete all personal data or data that readily identifies the user across the entire organization.            |
| **Rectification**    					| Update, or correct personal information the user believes to be incorrect about them.                      	|
| **Portability**    					| Obtain a machine-readable copy of the users personal data such that it might be imported to another system. |

## Users or Data Subjects
In privacy parlance, the owner of the personal data collected by your organization is commonly known as a **subject*.

## Subject Identity Verification
When you receive a privacy request, you are responsible for confirming the identity of the subject to ensure that you do not incorrectly disclose data. To verify the identify of a subject, you may not request additional information you do not already retain about the subject. For example, you cannot request a copy of a subject's drivers license if you do not already have this information.

## Authorized Agents
In some locations, an individual user (subject), may submit a privacy request themselves directly or appoint a third party, typically known as an ** authorized agent** to submit the privacy request on their behalf.
In the event you receive a privacy request from an agent, you must honor it provided you are satsified that the authorized agent has been appointed by the subject.

## Privacy Request Processing Timeframe
The subjects location determines the regulation that applies and with it, the time limit for when a privacy request must be completed. You may request an extension in some locations, provided you notify the subject promptly of the extension - typically within 28 days (Europe) and within 45 days (USA).

| Regulation                        | Timeframe                     | Extension                             | 
| :-------------------------------- | :-----------------------------| :------------------------------------	|
| **GDPR (EEA & UK)**				| 28 days (one calendar month)  | 56 days (three calendar month total)	|
| **US State Regulations**			| 45 days 						| 45 days (90 days total)				|
| **LGPD (Brazil)**    				| 15 days						| --									|											

## Exceptions to Privacy Requests
There are some situations where you may not be able, or required to complete a privacy request. It's important to know when these might apply and how to manage them. In each case yoou should evaluate the circumstances and risks for your specific organization to ensure you are complying at all times.

### Legal / Compliance Obligation
There are certaincategories of personal data that you may be required to retain in order to fulfill legal or compliance obligations, in such cases you are permittd to retain that data event when an erasure request is received provided you restrict the use of the data to that purpose.

<Callout type="info" emoji="">
##### Example
To correctly calculate and file tax liabilities an e-commerce company will need to use order history information and the user's location. If the customer makes a subject erasure request to the company, the order history and zip code may be exempt from deletion provided they are used only for this purpose.

### Confidentiality Risk
In circumstances where returning data to a subject might reveal confidential or sensitive information about any organization or another individual, you are not required to return that specific piece of information. 

<Callout type="info" emoji="">
##### Example
A Company provides an employment reference in confidence for one of their employees to another Company. If the employee makes a subject access request to either company, the reference is exempt from disclosure.
