# Consent Fundamentals: Methods of Consent

<TutorialKey duration="5" product="Fides" topic="Consent Management"/>

In this page, we'll review the various methods of consent and their requirements.

## Methods of Consent

There are several methods for gathering consent based on the location of the visitor and the applied regulations. Below are the most common:

* **Explicit, informed consent** is when a user is properly informed about the use of their data in order to give consent.
	* **Opt-In**: the user must opt-in to the processing of data _before_ any of their data can be processed.
	* **Opt-Out**: the user may opt-out at any time in the future at which point data processing must stop.

As shown above, opt-in consent requires the user to explicitly opt-in, while opt-out consent allows the user to opt-out at any time.

**Methods of Consent** are the method used to collect consent, such as _implicit_, _explicit opt-in_ or _opt-out_ consent.

### Opt-In Consent
Opt-In consent is more common in Europe (EEA) and is sometimes known as _"cookie consent"_ or a _"cookie banner"_, however, this can be misleading as it implies the requirement is to manage cookies or that it requires a banner.

The goal is to ensure personal data is only processed for the express uses that are agreed to by the visitor and is not about cookies, or about banners! Examples of opt-in consent include:
* **E-mail marketing**: opting in to receive a newsletter or other marketing materials.
* **Health care**: opting into the processing of personal medical data for healthcare purposes.

### Opt-Out Consent
Opt-Out consent is more common in the United States, particularly in response to new data privacy regulations such as CCPA and VCDPA. Read about [US Privacy Regulations](/regulations) here.

Opt-Out consent provides the visitor the ability to opt-out at any time, now or in the future of a data processing activity such as advertising if they no longer agree. Examples of opt-out consent include:
* **Data Sales**: opting out of the processing of personal data for purposes that constitute a "sale" under the CCPA.
* **Targeted Advertising**: opting out of the processing of personal data for the purpose of targeted advertising.
