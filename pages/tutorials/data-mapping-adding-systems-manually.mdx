# Data Mapping: Adding Systems Manually

<TutorialKey duration="4" product="Fides" topic="Data Mapping" video="true" interactive="true"/>

## Introduction
In this tutorial, you'll add a new system manually to your data map. By the end of this tutorial, you'll understand systems and data maps, and how to manage them in Fides.

## Prerequisites

For this tutorial you will need:

* A Fides Cloud or Fides Enterprise account
* The role of `Owner` or `Contributor` for your Fides organization.



## Adding systems manually

To start, navigate to **Data map** → **Add systems** and choose **Add a system** to add a system manually:

### Search for or Create your System
From here you can search the list of available system templates:

Alternatively, to create a custom system, select **Create system** from upper right corner:

<Callout emoji="ⓘ">Using a system template will speed up your privacy operations as it uses Fides built-in privacy intelligence to pre-populate and and pre-configure integrations for privacy request processing.</Callout>

### Complete your System's Information
Create your system by completing the required **System details** on the **System information** tab as follows:

* <span class="nx-absolute -nx-mt-20" id="system-details-name"></span>[System name](#system-details-name) - A unique and relevant name to identify the system on the data map and in reports.
* <span class="nx-absolute -nx-mt-20" id="system-details-fides-key"></span>[System Fides key](#system-details-fides-key) - A unique key to represent this system across all Fides resources. This only accepts alphanumeric characters, hyphens and underscores, and may not contain spaces.
* <span class="nx-absolute -nx-mt-20" id="system-details-description"></span>[System description](#system-details-description) - An optional description to help other users understand what this system is.

Next you will learn how to reduce manual data entry by using Fides' automated scanning and system discovery tools and then you will [describe the ways in which you use personal data in your system](./data-mapping-data-uses).
