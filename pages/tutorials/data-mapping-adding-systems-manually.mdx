### Complete your system's information

<Callout emoji="" type="info">If you're a Fides Enterprise customer, you can use our built-in privacy dictionary, Fides Compass, to pre-populate system info and data use information. Learn more at [Fides Privacy Dictionary](./data-mapping-dictionary)</Callout>

Create your system by completing the required **System details** on the **System information** tab as follows:

#### System details

* **Name***:  A unique and relevant name to identify the system on the data map and in reports.
* **Unique ID**: A unique identifier for the system that is automatically generated based on the system's name.

#### System dataset references
A dataset reference is a link to a (dataset configuration)[../user-guides/datasets] that will typically describe the schema of a data store, often including annotations for data categories. When datasets are referenced by a system, the categories annotated in the dataset will appear in the data map and be available for reporting.

#### Cookie properties
In this section, information is stored about how this system uses cookies.
* **This system uses cookies**: used to indicate that the system uses cookies
* **This system refreshes cookies**: used to indicate that the system automatically refreshes cookies. 
* **This system uses non-cookie trackers**: used to indicate that the system uses tracking methods other than cookies.
* **Maximum duration (seconds)**: the maximum lifespan of a cookie, measured in seconds.

#### Data processing properties

Next you will learn how to use [automated system discovery tools](./data-mapping-system-detection). and then you will [describe the ways in which you use personal data in your system](./data-mapping-data-uses).
