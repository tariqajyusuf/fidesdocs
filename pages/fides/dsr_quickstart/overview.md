# Get Started with DSR Automation

## Getting started
Ready to go from **zero** to **DSR automation**? This guide is designed to walk you through configuring Fides and automating your first Data Subject Request! 

<Callout>If you haven't already, make sure Fides is installed on your machine (or compute instance). Check out the [quickstart](../get_started/quickstart) or [advanced installation](../get_started/advanced) guides to ensure Fides is running.</Callout>

This guide will walk you through using the Fides UI to connect your [third-party services](./configure_connectors), and then [creating datasets](./connect_databases) to represent their contained tables.

Finally, you'll customize and deploy the Fides [Privacy Center](./privacy_center), which serves as your central hub to allow your users to submit privacy requests, and then [process your first DSR](./dsr_processing).

## Next steps
Need support? The Fides team is here to help! Our [community resources](../community/overview) are available to assist in answering questions and sharing ideas on Slack, Github, and more.
