# Advanced Installation Options

<Callout emoji="â“˜">Want to quickly experiment with Fides? Clone the [source repository](https://github.com/ethyca/fides) to utilize the built-in Docker Compose file, check out the lightweight [start-up guide](./quickstart), or use the [demo application](./sample_project) to go from "Zero to DSR Automation" in minutes!</Callout>

## Minimum requirements
See the the [project requirements](requirements) page to get started.

## Installation options
The Fides team maintains a Python package [published on PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/fides/), and a Docker image on the [ethyca/fides DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/ethyca/fides/tags).

### Using Docker
The published reference images contain all of the extras and dependencies for running the Python application, but do not contain the required Postgres database.

Run the following command to pull the latest image from Ethyca's [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/ethyca/fides):

```
docker pull ethyca/fides
``` 

### Using Pip
To install Fides from the published PyPI package, run:

```sh
pip install ethyca-fides
```

## Set up your database
Fides uses an application database for persistent storage. Configure your own Postgres database according to the configuration of your choice, ensuring it satisfies the [minimum requirements](./requirements).

Options include:
* Managed PostgreSQL database services (e.g. AWS RDS, GCP Cloud SQL, Azure Database)
* Self-hosted PostgreSQL Docker container with a persistent volume mount (e.g. on a Kubernetes cluster)
* Self-hosted PostgreSQL server (e.g. on an EC2 server)
<Callout emoti="!"> There is no reason to expose this database to the public internet as long as it will be accessible by your webserver.</Callout>

Once the database is up and running:
1. create a database user for the webserver (e.g. `fides`)
2. create a new database for the webserver (e.g. `fides`), and
3. assign a secure password 

Ensure you make note of your connection credentials, as those values will be used in later configuration steps.


## Set up your cache
To ensure personal data is never retained erroneously, Fides collects privacy request result data in a temporary Redis cache that automatically expires.

Any hosted Redis database that meets the [project requirements](./requirements) work for this purpose. Follow the deployment documentation of your choice to get set up your Redis cache.

Options include: 
* A simple Docker redis container (https://hub.docker.com/_/redis)
* A managed service (e.g. AWS ElastiCache, GCP Memorystore, Azure Cache, Redis Cloud)
<Callout emoti="!"> There is no reason to expose this cache to the public internet as long as it will be accessible by your webserver.</Callout>

Once your cache is available:
1. enable a password (via Redis [AUTH](https://redis.io/commands/auth/)) to provide additional security

Ensure you make note of your connection credentials, as those values will be used when configuring Fides.


## Configure Fides
Fides [configuration variables](./configuration) are maintained in either a `fides.toml` file, or environment variables. These should be replaced with the connection credentials for your Postgres and Redis instances, as well as any other information unique to your deployment. 

The minimum configuration variables are as follows: 

```sh
FIDES__DATABASE__SERVER="fides-db"
FIDES__DATABASE__USER="postgres"
FIDES__DATABASE__PASSWORD="fides"
FIDES__DATABASE__PORT=5432
FIDES__DATABASE__DB="fides"
FIDES__USER__ANALYTICS_OPT_OUT=false
FIDES__REDIS__HOST="redis"
FIDES__REDIS__PASSWORD="testpassword"
FIDES__REDIS__PORT= 6379
FIDES__REDIS__SSL=false
FIDES__REDIS__SSL_CERT_REQS="required"
FIDES__SECURITY__APP_ENCRYPTION_KEY="athirtytwocharacterencryptionkey"
FIDES__SECURITY__OAUTH_ROOT_CLIENT_ID="fidesadmin"
FIDES__SECURITY__OAUTH_ROOT_CLIENT_SECRET="fidesadminsecret"
FIDES__SECURITY__ROOT_USERNAME="root_user"
FIDES__SECURITY__ROOT_PASSWORD="Testpassword1!"
FIDES__ADMIN_UI__ENABLED=true
```

| Minimum Configuration Variables | |
| --- | --- |
| `FIDES__DATABASE__SERVER` | The hostname given to your PostgreSQL database server.
| `FIDES__DATABASE__USER` | The username created for Fides to access the PostgreSQL database server.
| `FIDES__DATABASE__PASSWORD` |  The password created for Fides to access the PostgreSQL database server.
| `FIDES__DATABASE__PORT` | The port for your PostgreSQL database server.
| `FIDES__DATABASE__DB` | The name of the PostgreSQL database.
| `FIDES__USER__ANALYTICS_OPT_OUT` | Whether you are opted in or out of sending analytics data to Ethyca.
| `FIDES__SECURITY__APP_ENCRYPTION_KEY` | An AES256 encryption key used for database and JSON encryption. Must be exactly 32 characters (256bits).
| `FIDES__SECURITY__OAUTH_ROOT_CLIENT_ID` | A customizable Client ID used for the "root" OAuth client.
| `FIDES__SECURITY__ROOT_PASSWORD` | A client secret used for the "root" OAuth client.
| `FIDES__SECURITY__ROOT_USERNAME` | A root user to log in as when accessing the UI.
| `FIDES__SECURITY__ROOT_PASSWORD` | A password for the root user.
| `FIDES__REDIS__HOST` | The hostname for your Redis cache.
| `FIDES__REDIS__PORT` | The port for your Redis cache.
| `FIDES__REDIS__PASSWORD` | The password created for Fides to access the Redis cache.


See the [Configuration guide](configuration) for a full list of settings, as well as a sample `fides.toml`.

## Running the webserver
Once configured, you can start your server:

Docker: 
```sh
docker run ethyca/fides
```

Python:
```sh
fides webserver
```

With the Fides webserver running, the hosted UI is available at `http://{server_url}/` (e.g. `http://localhost:8080/`). 

## Next steps
Now that Fides is up and running, you're ready to get started with [DSR automation](../dsr_quickstart/overview) and [data mapping](../data_mapping/overview)!
