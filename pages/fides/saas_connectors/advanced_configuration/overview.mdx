# Advanced Configuration

SaaS connectors in Fides are designed to be fully configuration-driven. This means that if a connector for a particular SaaS platform or API is not available, you have multiple options for loading a new connector during runtime. With this approach, there is no need to wait for a new release or even restart the server.
