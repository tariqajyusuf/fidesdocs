# Manage custom fields
Custom fields enable you to define metrics that are specific to your business for system information or taxonomy elements. 
Fides includes all the privacy-related fields that are typically required to prove compliance or export a ROPA but some organizations may want to capture additional information for internal tracking or reporting purposes.

Custom fields can be either open-text fields or drop-down lists of values that can be placed on the following resources: 

| Location | Resource | Description |
| ---------------- | ---------------- | ---------------- |
| System | Information | A custom field placed in `system:information` will appear for every **system** in the Data Map under the `System information` tab of the system portal. Individual values may be set for each system. These fields are reportable and will appear as columns in the Data Map table. |
| System | Data use declaration | A custom field placed in `system:data use` will appear for every **system**  in the Data Map under the `Data uses` tab of the system portal. Individual values may be set for each data use declaration. These fields are reportable and will appear as columns in the Data Map table.|
| Taxonomy | Data use | A custom field placed in `taxonomy:data use` will appear for every **data use** element in the Taxonomy and individual values may be set for each data use. These are not reportable fields and will not appear as columns in the data map. |
| Taxonomy | Data category | A custom field placed in `taxonomy:data category` will appear for every **data category** element in the Taxonomy and individual values may be set for each data category. These are not reportable fields and will not appear as columns in the data map.|
| Taxonomy | Data subject | A custom field placed in `taxonomy:data subject` will appear for every **data subject** elementin the Taxonomy and individual values may be set for each data subject. These are not reportable fields and will not appear as columns in the data map.|

Custom fields are managed using the **Custom fields** section of the Management panel in Fides UI:
