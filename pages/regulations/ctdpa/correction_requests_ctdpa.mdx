# CTDPA Step 03: Correction Requests for CTDPA

You may already be enabling consumers to correct personal information that they believe is incorrect in your business systems.

If users can log into a profile and modify their information in a way that will be updated across your business systems, then it is an adequate way to fulfill users' right to correct inaccurate information.

However, if your business has more complex data flows that require updating records across distributed systems, it is highly recommended to either process such correction requests manually system-by-system or use an automated privacy engineering solution like [Fides](https://fid.es/start) to do it for you.
