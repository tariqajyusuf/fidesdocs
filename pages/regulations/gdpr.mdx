# GDPR: What is it and how to comply?

The European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is the world's most foundational consumer data privacy law. Since going into effect in 2018, it has influenced successive global privacy laws like Brazil's LGPD and California's CPRA.Â 

GDPR grants European citizens "the right to the protection of personal data," which is a fundamental right and freedom in the EU. If your business collects and processes EU citizens' data, you'll need to understand and abide by GDPR's requirements before operating lawfully in the EU.

This guide will go over everything your business needs to know about GDPR. You'll get step-by-step instructions on how to comply with GDPR and how Ethyca can help you achieve compliance.
