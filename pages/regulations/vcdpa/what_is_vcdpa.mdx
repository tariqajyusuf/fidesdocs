# What is the VCDPA?

[The Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act (VCDPA)](https://law.lis.virginia.gov/vacodefull/title59.1/chapter53/) is a comprehensive consumer privacy law that protects the data privacy of all Virginia residents. CDPA went into effect on January 1, 2023, following California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA). Unlike in California, where the enforcement date is July 1, 2023, CDPA’s enforcement date was on the first day of the year.
