# VCDPA Step 03: Correction Requests for VCDPA

You may already be able to provide consumers with the ability to update the personal information that they believe is incorrect.

If your existing technology systems allow users to log into a profile and modify their information in a way that will be updated across your business systems, then this is an adequate way to fulfill users' right to correct inaccurate information.

However, if your business has more complex data flows that require updating records across distributed systems, it is highly recommended to either process such correction requests manually system-by-system, or use an automated privacy engineering solution like Fides to do it for you.
