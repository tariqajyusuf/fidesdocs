# VCDPA Step 06: Conduct Data Protection Assessments (DPAs)

Virginia’s privacy law requires businesses to perform data protection assessments (DPAs). DPAs are meant for businesses to evaluate the business benefits of processing users' personal data with the potential risks to users. Companies subject to VCDPA should assess the potential risks of:

1. Processing data for purposes of targeted advertising.
2. The sale of personal data.
3. Processing personal data for purposes of profiling.
4. Processing sensitive data.
5. Any processing activities involving personal data that present a heightened risk of harm to consumers.

The Attorney General may request that a company submits a DPA to determine compliance.

Unlike Europe's GDPR, there is no single standard form for risk evaluations today. However, answering the above questions for your business regularly and recording this evaluation as part of an audit trail will set you up for success to comply with Virginia’s privacy law.
