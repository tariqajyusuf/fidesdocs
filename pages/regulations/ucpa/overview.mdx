# UCPA: What is it and how to comply?

The fifth and final privacy law going into effect this year is the Utah Consumer Privacy Act (UCPA). Utahâ€™s privacy law will go into effect at the end of the year on December 31, 2023. 

Arguably the most business-friendly comprehensive consumer privacy law of the 2023 U.S. state privacy laws, UCPA uses a high revenue threshold to determine applicability. This means that many small businesses may be exempt from UCPA.

If your business operates in Utah or targets products or services to Utah residents, you may need to comply with UCPA. This guide will help you determine if UCPA applies to your business and give you a step-by-step walkthrough of how Ethyca can help you comply.
