# CPRA Step 04
# Respect the GPC or Global Privacy Control

    Although not directly a part of the CPRA, California’s regulator, the CPPA has made clear that it will prosecute businesses that do not comply with the GPC. The GPC, or [Global Privacy Control](https://globalprivacycontrol.org) is a global signal, set in a consumer’s browser that allows the user to opt out of data sharing for the purpose of marketing.

    Given this, it is the same as a user opting out on your website and is a signal you must respect. 

    In order to comply with the GPC you can implement the GPC directly using the GPC's [own specification and implementation guide](https://globalprivacycontrol.org/implementation). You also can implement via the [IAB’s USP API](https://globalprivacycontrol.org/implementation#USPAPI). 

    If you're interested in understaind more, you can read our [privacy engineering tutorial on what the GPC is and how to support it now](../gpc/overview).
