# CPRA Step 08
# Providing User Right to Correction
Depending on your business type, you may already be able to provide your Consumers with the ability to update their personal information where they believe it is incorrect. 

If your existing technology systems allow a user to login to a profile and modify, or update their information and assure that this will be updated across your business systems, then this would be an adequate solution to afford your Consumers via your privacy policy notices. 

However, in the event that you have more complex data flows that require updating records across distributed systems where race conditions, data locking and data availability concerns arise, it is highly recommended to either process such correction requests manually on a per system basis or institue an automated privacy engineering solution like [Fides](https://fid.es/start).
