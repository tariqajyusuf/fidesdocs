Starting this summer, the U.S. will have four state privacy laws enacted. The Connecticut Data Privacy Act (CTDPA) will go into effect on the same day as the Colorado Privacy Act (CTDPA) on July 1, 2023. 

If your business operates in Connecticut or targets products or services to Connecticut residents, you’ll need to comply with CTDPA. This guide will give you a step-by-step walkthrough of how Ethyca can help you comply with Connecticut's privacy law.
