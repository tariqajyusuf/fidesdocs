# Privacy Engineering Resources 

Fides is the world's most popular open-source privacy engineering stack and here the team at Ethyca will help you navigate the technical and legal aspects of privacy-as-code and governance-as-code. In the resources section you'll find practical guides and tutorials for every aspect of privacy engineering from data mapping, labeling and annotation through to data deletion strategies, consent management and complex issues such as propogating consent to engineering pipelines for your data and ML projects.

If you can't find what you need here ask over on the [Fides Slack Community](https://fid.es/join) or consider contributing too.
