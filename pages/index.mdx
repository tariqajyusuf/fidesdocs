Fides (pronounced */fee-dhez/*, from Latin: Fidēs) is an open-source Privacy-as-Code platform that lets you manage, maintain, and automate privacy compliance throughout your organization. 

Leveraging the powerful and lightweight [Fides language](https://ethyca.github.io/fideslang/), Fides provides automated data mapping, consent management, and data subject request fulfillment, with built-in support for regulations such as [GDPR](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/), [CCPA](/regulations/ccpa), [VCDPA](/regulations/vcdpa), and [LGPD](https://iapp.org/news/a/the-new-brazilian-general-data-protection-law-a-detailed-analysis/) by default.

## Why is it called Fides?

Fides was the goddess of trust and good faith in Roman paganism. Fides represented everything that was required for *"honor and credibility"* in every aspect of Roman life. In addition to this, Fides means *"reliability": reliability between two parties, which is always reciprocal*. Fides stood out for her embodiment of this project's philosophy - to provide developers with a powerful tool to make privacy a default feature of any software.
