# Fides Language

Fideslang (fee-dez-læŋg, from the Latin term "Fidēs" + "language") is a proposed model for a human-readable "taxonomy" of privacy-related data types, behaviors, and usages. Fideslang hopes to develop an interoperable community standard for building privacy regulation compliance into the typical software development process.

## Summary of Taxonomy Classification Groups

The Fides taxonomy, or categorization, is made up of four main classification groups. These groups are used together to describe the data types, uses, and processing behaviors of an entire tech stack, including both application processes and data storage.
