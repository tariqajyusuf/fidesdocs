## Why is it called Fides?

Fides was the goddess of trust and good faith in Roman paganism. Fides represented everything that was required for *"honor and credibility"* in every aspect of Roman life. In addition to this, Fides means *"reliability": reliability between two parties, which is always reciprocal*. Fides stood out for her embodiment of this project's philosophy - to provide developers with a powerful tool to make privacy a default feature of any software.
