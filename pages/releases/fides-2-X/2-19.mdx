### Migration Notes
In Fides 2.19, we did some updates to how we handle fields across the product for better user experience. 
The following fields, which were part of the data uses on the Fides taxonomy, have moved to the data use declarations on systems:
- `Legal basis` is now `Legal basis for processing`
- `Special category` is now `Special category data` > `Legal basis for processing`
- `Recipients` is now `Third parties` and accompanied by a new field, `Shared categories`

If any of these fields were populated on the taxonomy data uses, their values are automatically migrated to the system data use declarations when updating your system to version 2.19.

The following fields, which were part of a dataset, have been deprecated or moved. Where possible, the values will be migrated during upgrade:
- `Dataset` > `Joint controller` is now `System` > `Joint controller`
- `Dataset` > `Geographic Location` is now used to set `This system transfers data` to `true`
- `Dataset` > `Identifiability` has been deprecated
- `Dataset` > `Retention period` is now the `Retention period` on data use declarations


The following fields have been changed as indicated but values should be automatically migrated:
- `System` > `Geographic Location` is now a boolean called `This system transfers data` but there's a sub-field to specify the legal basis for transfer.
- `System` > `Data protection impact assessment` > `Is required` has been moved to `This system requires Data Privacy Assessments` and `System` > `Data protection impact assessment` > `Link`  has been migrated to `DPIA/DPA location`
- `System` > `Data Responsibility Title` has been moved to `System` > `Responsibility`
- `Data Use` > `Legitimate interest` is deprecated.
- `Data Use` > `Legitimate interest impact assessment` is deprecated, but existing value caused `Legal basis for processing` to be set to `Legitimate interests` and was also migrated to `Impact Assessment Location`
