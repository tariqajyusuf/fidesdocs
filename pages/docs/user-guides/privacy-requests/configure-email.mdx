# Configuring email content

When managing privacy requests, it's important to keep consumers informed about the progress of their requests. This is typically done through email updates, which can be customized both in terms of content and appearance. The following instructions outline how to modify the email content for each request type.

For instructions on adjusting the visual style of the emails, you'll need to make use of your chosen email vendor (such as SendGrid, Mailgun, or Twilio) to configure the styling accordingly.

The following types of emails are sent to as part of processing privacy requests:

| Type                        | Description                     | Variables (if applicable)                            | 
| -------------------------------- | -----------------------------| ------------------------------------	|
| Subject identity verification | An email used to confirm the identity of a data subject | `{{code}}`: automatically generated by Fides. `{{minutes}}`: set to 10 by default. For steps to update this value, please see the [section below](#configure-custom-values) |
