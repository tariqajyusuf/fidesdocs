# Configuring privacy request emails

When managing privacy requests, it's important to keep consumers informed about the progress of their requests. This is typically done through email updates, which can be customized both in terms of [content](/user-guides/privacy-requests/configure-email/email-content) and [appearance](/user-guides/privacy-requests/configure-email/email-style). The following instructions outline how to modify the email content for each request type.

The following types of emails may be sent while processing privacy requests:
* **Subject identify verification**: An email used to confirm the identity of a data subject.
* **Privacy request status**: An email sent to a data subject when a privacy request has been received, approved, or denied.
* **Access request completed**: An email sent to a data subject when an access request has been completed that includes a link to download the data package.
* **Erasure request completed**: An email sent to a data subject when an erasure request has been completed.
