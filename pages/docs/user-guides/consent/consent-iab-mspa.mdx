# Consent Management: IAB Multi-State Privacy Agreement (MSPA)

## What is the IAB Multi-State Privacy Agreement (MSPA)?
The Multi-State Privacy Agreement (MSPA) is an updated legal framework to support the growing number of US state privacy laws. The MSPA is designed to work with the Global Privacy Platform in order to simplify compliance for publishers by obtaining, collecting and signaling consent for publishers to advertisers using a standard contractual framework that directly supports the legal requirements of the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) and the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA), as well as the Colorado Privacy Act (CPA), Connecticut Data Privacy Act (CTDPA), Utah Consumer Privacy Act (UCPA), and Virginiaâ€™s Consumer Data Protection Act (VCDPA).

Although the MSPA appears to be a complex legal framework, its intended goal is to provide a single, simple standard for publishers, advertisers, agencies and technology partners to easily translate the appropriate legal obligations of consent on behalf of visitors on their site to every vendor involved in data processing for that visitor. 

In its simplest form, the MSPA, combined with GPP (Global Privacy Platform), provides a single, unified solution to ensuring consent is correctly obtained, recorded and signaled to every vendor on behalf of a website or mobile app visitor.
