# What are the different types of consent?
There are several methods of consent, depending on the location of your users and the laws that apply, these are:

* **(Explicit) Opt-in Consent**: where a user has directly confirmed they permit you to process their data for a specific purpose, like marketing. Typically, consent of this kind is given by checking on a box or turning on a toggle.
* **Implicit Consent**: where a user has provided their information for a business purpose but has not explicitly agreed to the use of their data for something like marketing. With implicit consent, you assume the userâ€™s consent.
* **(Explicit) Opt-out Consent**: where a user has explicitly opted out of the use of their data for a purpose such as marketing. Typically, opt-out consent is given by checking off a box or turning off a toggle.
