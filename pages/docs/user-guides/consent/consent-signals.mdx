# What are Consent Signals?
Consent signals are a template of how to send and receive a visitor's current consent choices between a publisher and a vendor, such as an advertiser or technology partner. Consent signals ensure a consistent and repeatable standard for sharing consent choices, or preferences between technology systems.

[IAB TCF](/docs/user-guides/consent/consent-iab-tcf), [USP](/docs/user-guides/consent/consent-iab-usp), [GPP](/docs/user-guides/consent/consent-iab-gpp) and [GPC](/docs/user-guides/consent/consent-gpc) are all types of consent signals.
