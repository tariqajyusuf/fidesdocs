# Consent Management: IAB Global Privacy Platform (GPP)

## What is the IAB Global Privacy Platform (GPP)?
In an effort to better standard publisher and advertiser data privacy compliance, the IAB (Internet Advertising Bureau) developed the Global Privacy Platform, a standard framework and consent signal intended to provide compliance for General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) and Digital Advertising Alliance (DAA).

The GPP was announced in June 2022, two years after the announcement of Project Rearc which involved cross-industry collaboration to define and develop a single standard for consent compliance. The goal of GPP is to simplify managing evolving privacy regulations across multiple geographies and markets so that publishers can more easily and consistently comply with privacy regulations and afford their consumer’s greater transparency.

Like the IAB TCF and USP, GPP is a standard framework for obtaining consumer consent, recording that consent and syndicating, or transmitting a user’s preferences of consent to vendors processing the user’s data.

## What is the benefit of IAB Global Privacy Platform (GPP)?
The GPP eliminates the need to integrate with multiple, varied privacy signal standards and instead provides a signal standard that supports both IAB TCF and IAB USPrivacy. The GPP provides a standard taxonomy that includes all known data purposes and uses to ensure it can function for nay location in the world, simplifying legal requirements into a signal interoperable standard.
