# Outreach
[Outreach](https://www.outreach.io/) is a sales engagement platform that helps sales teams effectively communicate with prospects and customers through personalized, automated outreach.

## Prerequisites

<Callout emoji="" type="info"> To integrate with Outreach, you'll need to setup a custom Outreach app. This ensures exclusive data control, enhances security by reducing unauthorized access risks, and allows customization of scopes and permissions to suit your business needs and policies.</Callout>

To configure a custom Outreach app using OAuth 2.0 for authentication, please follow [this Outreach guide](https://developers.outreach.io/client-extensions/your-first-outreach-extension/). 

Once you have this configured, you'll need to collect the following information:


| Name                       | Description                                                                                                                             |
| :------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Domain***                 | Your Outreach domain (default: `api.outreach.io`) |
| **Requester email***        | The email address of the Outreach user that created your custom app  |
| **Client ID***         | The OAuth 2.0 client ID for your application. For more info, see the Outreach [OAuth guide](https://developers.outreach.io/api/oauth/)  |
| **Client secret***     | The OAuth 2.0 client secret. For more info, see the Outreach [OAuth guide](https://developers.outreach.io/api/oauth/)|
| **Redirect URL***           | The Fides URL to which users will be redirected upon successful authentication (ex. `https://fides-host.com/oauth/callback`) | 
| **Page size***            | The number of results to return on each page. |

## Integrating with Outreach
To integrate an existing system with Outreach: 

1. Navigate to **Data map** â†’ **View Systems** and choose the system that you want to connect.
2. Click on the **Integrations** tab.
3. Pick the vendor or system type that you want to integrate with from the **Connection type** drop-down menu.
4. Complete the required fields for the integration and click **Save**.

To authorize the integration so that it can connect to Outeach:
1. Click on **Authorize integration** to be redirected to the Outreach authorization screen
2. Enter your credentials and click **Log in**. You will automatically be redirected back to the Fides UI using the `Redirect URL` that was provided in the form in the previous step.

You may now confirm your connection is working using the **Test connection** button, if desired.

To learn more, please see our guide for [Managing Integrations](/user-guides/integrations/manage-integrations).

## Technical detail 

Fides utilizes _API endpoints_ to access the _API service_ for a SaaS application. An _API service_ is the programmatic interface through which Fides can query and update data within an application to access, rectify, or delete personal information. Each SaaS tool will have a unique set of endpoints to enable privacy functions. 

### Outeach Endpoints
In the table below, you can find which endpoints are used for each type of privacy function. Clicking on the endpoint will take you to the documentation for that endpoint.

| Privacy function | Endpoint(s) | Description |
|----|----|----|
| **Access Requests** | [Prospects](https://developers.outreach.io/api/reference/tag/Prospect/) | Used to fetch prospects from Outreach. | 
| **Access Requests** | [Recipients](https://developers.outreach.io/api/reference/tag/Recipient/) | Used to fetch recipients from Outreach. |
| **Delete Requests** | [Prospects, Recipients](https://developers.outreach.io/api/reference/tag/Compliance-Request/) | Used to delete prospects and recipients in Outreach. | 


<Callout type="info" emoji="">
By default, deletion requests are fulfilled by masking personal information. To enable Fides to erase personal information instead of just masking it, ensure the `masking_strict` variable in your `fides.toml` file is set to `false`.
