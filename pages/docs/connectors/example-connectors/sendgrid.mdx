# Sendgrid

## Implementation Summary

Fides uses the following Sendgrid endpoints to retrieve and delete Personally Identifiable Information (PII) when processing a Privacy Request. Right to Access and Right to Delete (Right to Forget) support for each endpoint is noted below.

|Endpoint | Right to Access | Right to Delete |
|----|----|----|
|[Contacts](https://docs.sendgrid.com/api-reference/contacts/search-contacts) | Yes | Yes |

## Connection Settings

Connection instructions may be found in the [configuration guide](/docs/connectors/saas-config).

**Deletion requests** are fulfilled by masking PII via `UPDATE` endpoints.

To give Fides permission to delete personal data using `DELETE` endpoints, ensure the `masking_strict` variable in your `fides.toml` file is set to `false`. Read how to set [Fides configuration variables here](/docs/configuration/configuration#configuration-variable-reference).
