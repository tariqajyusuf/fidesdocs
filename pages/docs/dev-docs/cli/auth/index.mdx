# Authenticating & Managing Users via CLI


Fides is a platform that performs automated privacy tasks, offering a collaboration-focused environment that makes it easier for teams to quickly comply with privacy together.

Fides CLI integrates with Fides Server in several ways â€” it can be a front-end for CLI-driven tasks on Fides Server, and can also rely on Fides Server for a variety of privacy tasks. All of these sensitive endpoints require you to authenticate Fides CLI with your Fides Server.

The best way to handle CLI authentication is with the ```user login``` command, which help automate the process of creating an API token for your Fides Server.

In addition, once logged in, you can ```create``` new users or view the logged in user ```permissions```.
