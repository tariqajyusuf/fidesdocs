# Installing Fides

## Minimum requirements
See the the [project requirements](/dev-docs/get-started/requirements) to get started.

**If using Docker,** run `docker -v` in a new shell to confirm that docker is ready to use:

```bash filename="Example output:"
% docker -v
Docker version 20.10.11, build dea9396
```

**If using Python,** run `python --version` in a new shell to confirm that docker is ready to use:

```bash filename="Example output:"
% python --version
Python 3.9.13
```

Once you are sure Docker or Python is running, you are ready to install Fides!

### Using Docker 
Run the following command to pull the latest image from Ethyca's [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/ethyca/fides):

```
docker pull ethyca/fides
```

To pull the Fides Privacy Center, run the following:
```
docker pull ethyca/fides-privacy-center
```

### Running the webserver
Once downloaded, you can start the Fides UI and database:
```
docker run ethyca/fides
```

With the Fides webserver running, the hosted UI is available at `http://{server_url}/` (e.g. `http://localhost:8080/`).

## Using Pip
The Fides Python package is [published on PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/fides/) and maintained by the Fides team.
### Installation 
To install Fides, run:

```sh
pip install ethyca-fides
```
#### Initialize Fides

Initializing the project will create a configuration file with default values, and generate a directory to house your Fides resources.

```sh filename="Initialize Fides"
fides init
```

```txt filename="Expected Output"
