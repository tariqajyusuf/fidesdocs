# API: user

The `/api/v1/user` routes are a collection of routes that are used to create, read, update, and delete user objects within your Fides tenant. A user can also have Role-Based-Access-Control (RBAC) for specific systems using the `system-manager` endpoints. This might be known as Data Stewards for larger organizations.
