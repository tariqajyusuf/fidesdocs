# API: policy

The `/api/v1/policy` routes are a collection of routes that are used to create, read, update, and delete Data Map policies that can be used in tandem with [Fides Policy Checks](/dev-docs/cli/check/cmd-evaluate). In the [CI/CD Quickstart](https://fid.es/ci-cd-quickstart?utm_source=docsiteapidocs), we illustrate the policy as a flat YAML file within a repo, however, you can query this endpoint to get the policies dynamically.
