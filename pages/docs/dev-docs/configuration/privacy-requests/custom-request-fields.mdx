# Overview

This document explains how to configure configure custom fields that will be collected for privacy requests. 

## Enable custom fields 
To enable custom fields for privacy requests, please add following section to your `fides.toml` file:

```bash
[execution]
allow_custom_privacy_request_field_collection = true
allow_custom_privacy_request_fields_in_request_execution = true
```

## Configure custom fields
To add custom fields that will be collected for privacy requests, please add them to the Privacy Center's `config.json` file. 
You may specify:
* A `label`
* Whether or not the field is `required` for submission

Below is an example for adding the following 3 fields: *first name*, *last name*, and *order id*. 

```bash
"custom_privacy_request_fields": {
  "first_name": {
    "label": "First name",
    "required": true
  },
  "last_name": {
    "label": "Last name",
    "required": false
  },
  "order_id": {
    "label": "Order ID",
    "required": true
  }
}
```

## Collecting custom field information
Once custom fields have been configured, your consumer will be presented with the new options when filing a privacy request. 

For example, the configuration above would result in the following form options:

## Reviewing custom field information
When reviewing privacy requests, the custom fields that were collected from the Privacy Center will appear in the privacy requeset detail. 

Here is an example using the configuration above:
