# CCPA: What is it and how to comply?

The first U.S. state privacy law that went into effect on January 1, 2023 is California's amended privacy law.

The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) originally went into effect in 2018. The law was later amended in 2020 by the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA), which provides California residents with stricter protections over their personal data. 

If your business operates in California or targets products or services to California residents, you may need to comply with CCPA as amended by CPRA. This guide will give you a step-by-step walk-through of how Ethyca can help you comply with California's updated privacy law.
