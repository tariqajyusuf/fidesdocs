# CPA Step 05: Portability Requests for CPA

Processing a userâ€™s right to data portability is identical to an access request. The key difference is that the data returned to the user should be in a machine-readable format that could be transferred to another vendor or business.

For example, in a typical access request, you can return this data to the user in any format that is easy to read and understand, such as a PDF or spreadsheet.

In the case of data portability, you must provide these records in a machine-readable format that other systems can process and display. Common examples of these formats include JSON, CSV, or XML.
