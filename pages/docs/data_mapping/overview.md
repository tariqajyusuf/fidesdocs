# Get Started with Data Mapping

## Getting started
This guide is designed to walk you through configuring Fides to generate your first data map! 

<Callout>If you haven't already, make sure Fides is installed on your machine (or compute instance). Check out the [quickstart](../installation/quickstart) or [advanced installation](../installation/advanced) guides to ensure Fides is running.</Callout>

This guide will walk you though you using the Fides UI to [scan for systems](./scanners), and then register those results with Fides. Finally, you'll be able to [export a data map](./datamap) via the Fides CLI.

## Next steps
