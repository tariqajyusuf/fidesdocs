# Fides Configuration

Fides can be configured in two different ways: either via a ```toml``` file or via environment variables. Both methods can be used simultaneously, with environment variables taking precedence over the ```toml``` file values.

We've designed Fides so that an average user running Fides CLI interactively won't need to interact with any of the global Fides settings. As a result, most of the global settings relate to configuring the Fides server, providing credentials to systems, advanced CI integrations, configuring messaging service providers, storage destinations and advanced automation tools.

## Viewing Fides Configuration
As part of configuring or debugging Fides it may be necessary to view the current configurations of the Fides CLI and Fides Server together. 
The ```fides view``` command is designed specifically to output the current configurations of a Fides instance for review.
