# Running Fides Webserver

The Fides CLI integrates with the Fides Server to provide a central solution for collaboration on privacy and data governance tasks for teams.

The Fides Server can be run locally, deployed to a cloud provider, or hosted by Ethyca. The Fides Server unifies all privacy resources and provides a UI for collaborating and simplifying privacy tasks. For details on how to configure and deploy Fides server read the [Fides installation guide](/docs/get-started/advanced) here. 

## Running the Webserver
The ```fides webserver``` command will use the first [Fides configuration](#LINK) it can read from to determine default state and start the Fides Webserver.

With the Fides Webserver running, the hosted UI is available at ```http://{server_url}/``` (e.g. ```http://localhost:8080/```).

For details, see [the ```fides webserver``` command](webserver/cmd-webserver).

## Managing the database 
The ```fides db``` command accepts several subcommands to manage the primary Fides database for the Fides Server. Where necessary this supports initializing the database or resetting the database to its freshly initialized state.

For details, see [the ```fides db``` command](webserver/cmd-db).

## Checking server status
The ```fides status``` command will make a request to the Fides server to check its health, current version and report back any possible issues.

For details, see [the ```fides status``` command](webserver/cmd-status).
