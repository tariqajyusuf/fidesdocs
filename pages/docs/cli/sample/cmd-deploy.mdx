# Command: deploy

> **Hands-on:** Try the [Fides: Get Started](#LINK) tutorials.

The ```fides deploy``` command starts the Cookie House sample project for testing and learning about Fides. The Cookie House is a fictional e-commerce application built in Next.js and with sample PostgreSQL and MongoDB databases for testing.

<Callout emoji="">**Note:** The Cookie House sample project requires a current version of Python and Docker Desktop. For more assistance with this try the [Fides: Get Started](#LINK) tutorials</Callout>

## Usage
Usage: ```fides deploy <command>```

The following subcommands are available:

* <span class="nx-absolute -nx-mt-20" id="up"></span>[```up```](#up) - Deploy the Cookie House sample project using Docker.
* <span class="nx-absolute -nx-mt-20" id="down"></span>[```down```](#down) -  Destroy the Cookie House sample project and remove all user-created data so it can be restarted cleanly.

Running this command should result in output that resembles the examples below.
