# Automated Privacy Checks

One of the main benefits of Fides is to speed up and simplify data cataloguing and data inventory management with tools built for data annotation. Fides' annotations include all of the information necessary to ensure compliance with global privacy and data governance regulations. A key part of compliance is ensuring that all data is adequately labeled.

Fides CLI includes commands specifically intended to scan and report on annotation coverage to ensure that no systems or datasets are missed and that the entirety of the tech stack is adequately labeled.
These commands can be scheduled to periodically scan and report on annotation coverage, identifying possible risks where data annotation is incomplete.

## Evaluating Privacy
The ```fides evaluate``` command is a powerful way to automatically check if changes to projects and data models comply with privacy and data governance policies. Fides achieves this by combining all local resources and annotations with remote resources on the Fides server and checking these against Fides policies. Fides policies are a customizable set of rules and conditions that can be used to define rules that new or system modifications must meet.

By default the ```fides evaluate``` command is an easy-to-use CLI command, however it can be configured as part of automated CI checks with Git hooks to continuously integrate privacy checks into an existing pipeline, making privacy a consistent, agile part of existing workflows. For details on how policies are used read the [Guide to Fides Policies](#LINK) here.
