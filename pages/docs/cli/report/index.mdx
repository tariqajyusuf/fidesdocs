# Exporting Reports from Fides

One of Fides' most powerful features is the ability to export reports for compliance with multiple global privacy regulations including the GDPR in Europe, the CCPA in California, the LGPD in Brazil, and PIPL in China.
Reports can be generated from both the CLI and the Fides UI. For more in-depth details on reporting, check out the [Building and Exporting Reports in Fides](#LINK) tutorials.
