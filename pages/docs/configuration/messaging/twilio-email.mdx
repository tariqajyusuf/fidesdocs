# Configure Twilio (SendGrid) for Email

This document explains how to configure email notification and messaging services with Twilio (SendGrid) and Fides.

## Prerequisites

In order to complete this, you will need the following:
* A valid Twilio (SendGrid) account with which to send emails.
* Ability to access and update Fides system config variables for your Fides installation. Read about [config variables](#LINK) here.
* Fides OAuth access token with the following scopes. Read about [Fides Scopes](#LINK) here.
    * `messaging:read`: Read an existing messaging configuration.
    * `messaging:create_or_update`: Create or update messaging configuration.
    * `messaging:delete`: Delete a messaging configuration.
    * `config:read`: Read Fides system configurations.
    * `config:update`: Update Fides system configurations.


## Generate your Twilio (SendGrid) API Key

In order to configure Twilio (SendGrid) as a messaging provider for Fides you will need a Twilio API Key. 
You can do this by following the [Twilio documentation](https://www.twilio.com/docs/iam/keys/api-key) to create an API key here.

The default template will use a text based template. Alternatively, you can provide a custom template using the following steps.

### Using SendGrid templates with Twilio

1. Within SendGrid create a dynamic template named `fides`
1. The template can be setup as desired, but needs to contain a `{{fides_email_body}}`
   variable. This is where the Fides email text will be placed.
1. In order to use the email template the Twilio API key needs to be provided in the
   Fides Twilio configuration.

When sending emails Fides will check to see if the `fides` template is available and use
it if so. If a `fides` template is not found the email will fall back to using the generic
Fides email template.

## Example: Set Twilio (SendGrid) as the default messaging provider

To set Twilio (SendGrid) as the default messaging provider, make a **PUT** request to the `api/v1/messaging/default` endpoint as follows:

```console filename="PUT /api/v1/messaging/default"
curl '{{FIDES_URL}}/api/v1/messaging/default' \
-X PUT \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer {{FIDES_ACCESS_TOKEN}}' \
-d '{
    "service_type": "twilio_email",
    "details": {
        "twilio_email_from": "{{TWILIO_FROM_EMAIL}}"
    }
}'
```
In the above example `{{FIDES_URL}}` is the URL to your Fides server. The Authorization is Bearer and `{{FIDES_ACCESS_TOKEN}}` is your Fides access token. The request Content-Type is application/json.

The `service_type` is `twilio_email` and `{{TWILIO_FROM_EMAIL}}` is the "From Email" you'd like to send messages from.

The response to this request will return the configuration for the default messaging provider, including your `twilio_email_from` and a `key` as shown below:

```json filename="Default Messaging Provider Response"
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "service_type": "twilio_email",
    "details": {
        "twilio_email_from": "{{TWILIO_FROM_EMAIL}}"
    },
    "name": "Default Messaging Config [twilio_email]",
    "key": "default_messaging_config_twilio_email"
}
```

## Example: Add Twilio (SendGrid) API Key
Next, you can add the API key generated in Twilio (SendGrid) to your Twilio configuration by making a **PUT** request to the `api/v1/messaging/default/twilio_email/secret` endpoint as follows:

```console filename="PUT /api/v1/messaging/default/twilio_email/secret"
curl '{{FIDES_URL}}/api/v1/messaging/default/twilio_email/secret' \
-X PUT \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer {{FIDES_ACCESS_TOKEN}}' \
-d '{
    "twilio_api_key": "{{TWILIO_API_KEY}}"
}'
```
In the above example `{{FIDES_URL}}` is the URL to your Fides server. The Authorization is Bearer and `{{FIDES_ACCESS_TOKEN}}` is your Fides access token. The request Content-Type is application/json.

The `{{TWILIO_API_KEY}}` is your Twilio API Key as created in [this section](#generate-your-twilio-sendgrid-api-key).

The response to this request will be a confirmation message that the secret has been updated for the configuration identified by the `key` as shown in this example:

```json filename="Default Messaging Provider Response"
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "msg": "Secrets updated for MessagingConfig with key: default_messaging_config_twilio_email.",
    "test_status": null,
    "failure_reason": null
}
```

## Messaging Config Variables
Fides allows you to configure which messaging service is used to send each system notification. To do this you must update Fides' system-wide settings to ensure that your Twilio service is selected for each notification. Below is a list of the notification cofigurations that can be set:


| Name                                   | Type   | Default | Description                                                                                                        |
| :------------------------------------- | :----- | :-------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `send_request_receipt_notification`    | bool   | `false` | When set to `true`, sends notification to subject to confirm reciept of their request.                                    |
| `send_request_review_notification`     | bool   | `false` | When set to `true`, sends notification to subject to confirm their request is in review.                                     |
| `send_request_completion_notification`     | bool   | `false` | When set to `true`, sends notification subject when their request has been completed.                                     |
| `notification_service_type`            | String | N/A     | Sets the notification service type used to send notifications. Accepts `mailgun`, `twilio_text`, or `twilio_email`. |
| `subject_identity_verification_required` | bool | `false` | Whether privacy requests require user identity verification.                                                                                                                                                                                  |

## Example: Set Messaging Config Variables
You can update your Fides messaging configuration by making a **PATCH** request to the `api/v1/config` endpoint as follows:

```console filename="PATCH /api/v1/config"
curl '{{FIDES_URL}}/api/v1/config' \
-X PATCH \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer {{FIDES_ACCESS_TOKEN}}' \
-d '{
  "notifications": {
    "notification_service_type" : "twilio_email",
    "send_request_receipt_notification": true,
    "send_request_review_notification": true,
    "send_request_completion_notification": true
  },
  "execution": {
    "subject_identity_verification_required": true
  }
}'
```
In the above example `{{FIDES_URL}}` is the URL to your Fides server. The Authorization is Bearer and `{{FIDES_ACCESS_TOKEN}}` is your Fides access token. The request Content-Type is application/json.

The `notification_service_type` value is `twilio_email` and for each of the notifications you wish to send via Twilio, set their value to `true`.
You can also enable or disable subject identify verification on privacy requests here by settting `execution.subject_identity_verification_required` to `true`. Learn more about [Subject Identify Verification](#LINK) here.

The response to this request will confirm the service type and the current status for each notification as shown in the example below:

```json filename="Fides Configuration Update Response"
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "notifications": {
        "send_request_completion_notification": true,
        "send_request_receipt_notification": true,
        "send_request_review_notification": true,
        "notification_service_type": "twilio_email"
    },
    "execution": {
        "subject_identity_verification_required": true
    }
}
```

## Check the messaging configuration status
To check that your messaging configuration has been fully configured, you can invoke the status endpoint at `/api/v1/messaging/default/status`.

```console filename="GET /api/v1/messaging/default/status"
curl '{{FIDES_URL}}/api/v1/messaging/default/status' \
-X GET \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer {{FIDES_ACCESS_TOKEN}}' \
-d ''
```
If everything is correctly configured you will receive a response similar to the example below with `config_status` of "configured".

```json filename="Fides Configuration Update Response"
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "config_status": "configured",
    "detail": "Active default messaging service of type twilio_email is fully configured"
}
```
