# Privacy Requests: Identifying & Debugging Issues

<TutorialKey duration="2" product="Fides" topic="Privacy Requests" interactive="true"/>

<Callout emoji=""> This tutorial requires Fides Cloud or Fides Enterprise. For more information, [talk to our solutions team.](https://ethyca.com/book-demo?utm_source=docs-site) </Callout>

## Introduction
In this tutorial, you'll learn how to review the event logs for a privacy request and identify issues that may require debugging.

## Prerequisites

For this tutorial, you'll need:

* A Fides Cloud or Fides Enterprise account
* The role of either `Owner`, `View & Approver` or `Approver` to manage privacy requests.
* At least one system integration configured for privacy requests. Read how to [configure an integration](/docs/tutorials/privacy-requests-configuration/integrations).
* A privacy center to receive and process privacy requests. Read how to [configure a privacy center](/docs/tutorials/consent-management-configuration/privacy-experiences/privacy-center).



## Identifying Privacy Request Issues
From time-to-time, privacy requests can fail to process completely. This is often due to the sheer number of systems connected in a privacy process and how they depend on each other to complete successfully. 
A common reason for a privacy request to fail is expired credentials to a system, however, there can be a variety of other reasons. Identifying the cause as quickly as possible to remediate it is key.

Fides provides a detailed events and activities log for this very reason. Let's take a walk through of the feature now.

## Viewing Request Logs

To view the event logs for a given request, click the kebab menu `...` and select **View Details** as follows:

If the privacy request has already been processed, the event logs will show a list of the processed systems under **Events and Logs** as shown below:

To view the the details of a specific system's privacy request processing, click on "View Details" and then "View log" to show the detailed processing log for the system:

This detailed view of events shows exactly what action has been performed for each system and the available collections, so you can identify precisely where an issue occurs with a privacy request for debugging.
