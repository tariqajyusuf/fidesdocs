# Annotating datasets using the CLI

This process will require having the Dataset YAML file locally. If using Fides Cloud, you will need to follow the [steps to pull Datasets locally](/tutorials/privacy-requests-configuration/privacy-requests-dataset-annotation#pull-the-generated-dataset-locally).

At this point, we should be able to use the `annotate` command:

```bash
$ fides annotate dataset .fides/<your_dataset>.yaml
> Loaded config from: /fides/.fides/fides.toml
####
Annotating Dataset: [sample_dataset]
####
Annotating Table: [user]

Field [user.id] has no data categories

Enter comma separated data categories for [id] [s: skip, q: quit]:
```

The on screen prompts will walk you through the annotation process, also allowing for you to save state if you do not complete the annotations in one go.

```bash
...
Enter comma separated data categories for [id] [s: skip, q: quit]: system.operations
Setting data categories for user.id to:
            ['system.operations']

Annotation process complete.
```
