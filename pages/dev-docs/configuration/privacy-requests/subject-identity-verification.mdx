# Subject Identity Verification
When you receive a privacy request, you are responsible for confirming the identity of the subject to ensure that you do not incorrectly disclose data. To verify an identity, you may only request additional information you already retain about the subject. For example, you can't request a copy of a subject's drivers license if you don't already have this information.

Ethyca recommends using multi-factor authentication (MFA) for identify verification and Fides offers built-in subject identity verifiation via MFA.

## Configuring Subject Identity Verification
To enable Subject Identity Verification, you need to set

1. [Configure a messaging service](#configuring-a-messaging-service)

You may also customize the content of the email that is sent for this purpose. See our guide for [configuring email content](../../../user-guides/privacy-requests/configure-email) to learn more
