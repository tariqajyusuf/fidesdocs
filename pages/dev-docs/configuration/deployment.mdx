# Deployment Guide

<Callout> This guide is intended for production deployments. To quickly experiment with Fides, clone the [source repository](https://github.com/ethyca/fides), and use the built-in docker compose configuration to run a demo environment. </Callout>

A production-ready instance of Fides can be deployed leveraging the cloud infrastructure your organization is most familiar with.

Fully deployed, Fides consists of the following individual systems:

1. [**Hosted Database**](#set-up-the-hosted-database): A PostgreSQL database server used for permanent storage of configuration data for the webserver.
2. [**Hosted Cache**](#set-up-the-hosted-cache): A Redis database server used as a temporary cache during execution and task scheduling.
3. [**Fides Webserver**](#set-up-the-webserver): The main application, which houses the Admin UI and API endpoints.

Optionally, the Fides [**Privacy Center**](#set-up-the-privacy-center-optional) can be deployed as a pre-built way to receive privacy requests.

## Deployment options
Any Docker host can be used to deploy Fides, and this guide outlines three main deployment options: [Helm](#using-helm), [Terraform](#using-terraform), and [Docker](#using-docker). For all options, please refer to our [security best practices](/dev-docs/configuration/security-practices) for recommendations on production infrastructure.


### Using Helm
For a Kubernetes deployment, the recommendation option is to use the Fides [Helm chart](https://github.com/ethyca/fides-helm).

To install the Helm chart to an existing Kubernetes cluster, run the following commands:

```
helm repo add ethyca https://helm.ethyca.com
helm pull ethyca/fides
```

Then, set the required values in a values.yaml file and run 

```
helm install fides ethyca/fides --values values.yaml
```

For more information on installing the Fides Helm chart, please refer to the [Helm chart's README](https://github.com/ethyca/fides-helm/blob/main/fides/README.md)

### Using Terraform
For non-Kubernetes deployments, the Fides team maintains a [Terraform module](https://github.com/ethyca/fides-terraform) to assist in the deployment of Fides.

To install Fides and its required infrastructure using Terraform to AWS Elastic Container Service (ECS), please refer to the [Terraform module's README](https://github.com/ethyca/fides-terraform/blob/main/fides-aws-ecs/README.md)

### Using Docker

The remainder of this guide outlines generic steps for manually deploying the databases & Docker images that you can adapt to your preferred Docker host.

## Set up the hosted database

Fides uses an application database for persistent storage. Any hosted PostgreSQL database that meets the current [project requirements](/dev-docs/get-started/requirements) is acceptable, as long as it's accessible. 

Options include:

* A managed PostgreSQL database services (e.g., AWS RDS, GCP Cloud SQL, Azure Database)
* A self-hosted PostgreSQL Docker container with a persistent volume mount (e.g., a Kubernetes cluster)
* A self-hosted PostgreSQL server (e.g., an EC2 server)

<Callout> As long as your database will be accessible by your Fides webserver, there is no need to expose it to the public internet. </Callout>

### Configure your database
Follow the documentation for the option of your choice to configure a production-grade PostgreSQL database.

Once your database is up and running, create a **unique user** and **database** for Fides to use, and assign your Fides user a secure password.  

### Update your Fides configuration
Use your database information to set the following values in your Fides configuration. The options for the `[postgres]` section of the `fides.toml` file are outlined below, but may be substituted with environment variables.

| Name | Default | Description |
| :---- | :------- | :----------- |
| `user` | `postgres` | The database user Fides will use to log in to the application database. |
| `password`| `fides` | The password for the Fides user. |
| `server` | `fides-db` | The hostname of the Postgres database server. |
| `port` | `5432` | The port at which the Postgres database will be accessible. |
| `db` | `fides` | The name of the Postgres database. |

## Set up the hosted cache

During privacy request execution, Fides collects result data in a temporary Redis cache that automatically expires to ensure personal data is never retained erroneously. Any hosted Redis database that meets the current [project requirements](/dev-docs/get-started/requirements) is acceptable, from a Docker [Redis](https://hub.docker.com/_/redis) container to a managed service (e.g., AWS ElastiCache, GCP Memorystore, Azure Cache, Redis Cloud).

<Callout> As long as your cache will be accessible by your Fides webserver, there is no need to expose it to the public Internet. </Callout>

### Configure your cache
Follow the documentation for the option of your choice to configure a production-grade Redis cache.

Once your cache is available, ensure you enable a password (via Redis [`AUTH`](https://redis.io/commands/auth)) to provide additional security, and keep track of your connection credentials.

### Update your Fides configuration
Use your database information to set the following values in your Fides configuration. The options for the `[redis]` section of the `fides.toml` file are outlined below, but may be substituted with environment variables.

| Config Variable | Example | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | 
| `host` | N/A | The network address for the application Redis cache. |
| `port` | `6379` | The port at which the application cache will be accessible. |
| `user`  | N/A | The user with which to login to the Redis cache. |
| `password` | N/A | The password with which to login to the Redis cache. |
| `db_index` | N/A | The application will use this index in the Redis cache to cache data. |

## Set up the webserver

The Fides webserver is a [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) application with a [Uvicorn](https://www.uvicorn.org/) server to handle requests. The host requirements for the webserver are minimal:

* A general purpose webserver (e.g. for AWS EC2, a `t2.small` or larger)
* Docker version 20.10.8 or newer (if installing via Docker)
* OR Python 3.8 or newer (if installing via Python)
* No persistent storage requirements (this is handled by the hosted database)

### Using docker

Ensure that Docker is running on your host, and satisfies the [minimum requirements](/dev-docs/get-started/requirements).

#### Pull the docker image
Run the following command to pull the latest image from Ethyca's [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/ethyca/fides):

```
docker pull ethyca/fides
``` 

#### Configure Fides
A number of environment variables are required for a minimum working configuration. You can provide a configuration by creating an `.env` file and passing it in via the [`--env-file {file}` option](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/#set-environment-variables--e---env---env-file), by providing individual variables with the `--env {VAR}` option, or directly to your docker host.

At a minimum, you'll need to configure the following:

| Config Variable | Example | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `FIDES__SECURITY__APP_ENCRYPTION_KEY` | athirtytwocharacterencryptionkey | An AES256 encryption key used for DB & JWE encryption. Must be exactly 32 characters (256bits). |
| `FIDES__SECURITY__OAUTH_ROOT_CLIENT_ID` | fidesadmin | The client ID used for the "root" OAuth client. |
| `FIDES__SECURITY__OAUTH_ROOT_CLIENT_SECRET` | fidesadminsecret | The client secret used for the "root" OAuth client. |
| `FIDES__DATABASE__SERVER` | postgres.internal | The hostname for your database server. |
| `FIDES__DATABASE__PORT` | 5432 | The port for your database server. |
| `FIDES__DATABASE__USER` | fides | The username Fides should use to access the database. |
| `FIDES__DATABASE__PASSWORD` | fidessecret | The password Fides should use to access the database |
| `FIDES__DATABASE__DB` | fides | The postgres database name. |
| `FIDES__REDIS__HOST` | redis.internal | The hostname for your Redis server. |
| `FIDES__REDIS__PORT` | 6379 | The port for your Redis server. |
| `FIDES__REDIS__PASSWORD` | fidessecret | The password Fides should use to access Redis. |


#### Start your server

Once pulled, you can start your server with:

```
docker run ethyca/fides -p 8080:8080
```

To include your environment variables, you can run the following: 
```sh
docker run \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  --env FIDES__SECURITY__APP_ENCRYPTION_KEY="athirtytwocharacterencryptionkey" \
  --env FIDES__SECURITY__OAUTH_ROOT_CLIENT_ID="fidesadmin" \
  --env FIDES__SECURITY__OAUTH_ROOT_CLIENT_SECRET="fidesadminsecret" \
  --env FIDES__DATABASE__SERVER="postgres.internal" \
  --env FIDES__DATABASE__PORT="5432" \
  --env FIDES__DATABASE__USER="fides" \
  --env FIDES__DATABASE__PASSWORD="fidessecret" \
  --env FIDES__DATABASE__DB="fides" \
  --env FIDES__REDIS__HOST="redis.internal" \
  --env FIDES__REDIS__PORT=6379 \
  --env FIDES__REDIS__PASSWORD="fidessecret" \
  ethyca/fides
```

If you prefer to create your .env file and pass an `--env-file` variable: 
```
docker run \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  --env-file=<ENV FILE NAME>.env \
  ethyca/fides
```

```sh filename="config.env"
FIDES__SECURITY__APP_ENCRYPTION_KEY="athirtytwocharacterencryptionkey" 
FIDES__SECURITY__OAUTH_ROOT_CLIENT_ID="fidesadmin" 
FIDES__SECURITY__OAUTH_ROOT_CLIENT_SECRET="fidesadminsecret" 
FIDES__DATABASE__SERVER="postgres.internal" 
FIDES__DATABASE__PORT="5432" 
FIDES__DATABASE__USER="fides" 
FIDES__DATABASE__PASSWORD="fidessecret" 
FIDES__DATABASE__DB="fides" 
FIDES__REDIS__HOST="redis.internal" 
FIDES__REDIS__PORT=6379 
FIDES__REDIS__PASSWORD="fidessecret"
```

Note that there's no need for a persistent volume mount. The webserver is fully ephemeral, and relies on the database for its permanent state.

### Test the webserver

To test that your server is running, visit `http://{server_url}/health` in your browser (e.g. http://0.0.0.0:8080/health) and you should see `{"webserver": "healthy", "database": "healthy", "cache": "healthy"}`. 

You can also visit the hosted UI at `http://{server_url}/`.

## Set up the Privacy Center (Optional)

Ensure that Docker is running on your host, and satisfies the [minimum requirements](/dev-docs/get-started/requirements).

Run the following command to pull the latest image from Ethyca's [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/ethyca/fides):

```
docker pull ethyca/fides-privacy-center
``` 

More information about configuration options can be found in [this guide](/guides/privacy-center).

Once pulled and configured, you can run the following within your project to start the server: 

```sh
docker run --rm \
  -v $(pwd)/config:/app/config \
  -p 3000:3000 ethyca/fides-privacy-center:latest
```
