# Creating OAuth Clients

Because the root client's token contains all scopes, it can create new clients and new client ID/client secret pairs which can be used to create additional access tokens.


## Prerequisites

In order to complete this, you will need one of the following:

* A valid `access_token` created from a client credentials with adequate _**scopes**_ to create additional clients. Read how to [generate an access token](generating-tokens) here.

<Callout>Best practices recommend creating client credentials with the scope `CLIENT_CREATE` to create any new clients. This will help to reduce the utilization of the all-scopes root client.</Callout>

## Example: Create new OAuth Client
To create a new client ID and client secret, make **POST** request to the `/api/v1/oauth/client` endpoint using an access token with appropriate scopes as shown in the example below:

```console filename="POST /api/v1/oauth/client"
curl 'http://localhost:8080/api/v1/oauth/client' \
-X POST \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-H 'Authorization: Bearer {{FIDES_ACCESS_TOKEN}}' \
-d '["policy:read", "rule:read"]'
```

The Authorization header should be `Bearer`, where `{{FIDES_ACCESS_TOKEN}}` is your access token and the request `Content-Type` should be `application/json`.

To add scopes to the client, the body of your request must contain an array of scopes in the form `key: scope_value`.

In the above example, the new access token only lets the client read policies and rules. The client cannot create other clients, write policies, or perform other operations using Fides APIs. 
You can view a complete list of [available scopes](#LINK) here.

A successful request to Fides will respond with a new client ID client secret pair similar to the example below:

```json filename="New OAuth Client Response"
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "client_id" : "c0508a70e08f9f49de23eace66664d1d",
  "client_secret" : "5fac65211cbd005b390c073b3912af14",
}
```
## Create an access token

You can then create an access token for the client credentials by calling `POST /api/v1/oauth/token` with the new credentials and following the steps to [generate a token here](generating-tokens).
