# Connecting CLI to Fides Cloud

In this guide, we will setup the Fides CLI on your local machine and connect it to your Fides Cloud instance so that you can programmatically push & pull resources, evaluate privacy checks, and much more!

<Callout emoji="" type="info">This guide is for Fides Cloud, hosted edition. For alternative information about deploying Fides to your cloud [read the quickstart guide](/dev-docs/get-started/) here.</Callout>

We'll break this down into these steps:
1. Create and use a new Python virtual environment
2. Install Fides CLI via ```pip```
3. Connect your Fides CLI to Fides Cloud
4. Login to your Fides Cloud instance

Let's get started!

## Prerequisites
For this guide you'll need:

* A Fides Cloud or Fides Enterprise account
* Python 3.8+ installed locally (read more about [version requirements](/dev-docs/get-started/requirements#version-requirements))

## Create and use a new Python virtual environment

Since we'll be installing the Fides CLI using the [ethyca-fides](https://pypi.org/project/ethyca-fides/) Python package, it's best practice to first create a new Python virtual environment to install into (read more about virtual environments here: [Python Packaging User Guide](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/)).

First, create a new project directory on your local machine where you'll setup your CLI. For this guide, we'll use a folder called ```~/fides-cloud``` in your home directory like so:
```console
mkdir ~/fides-cloud
cd ~/fides-cloud
```

Next, from within your project directory, create a Python virtual environment. For this guide, we'll call it ```venv```: 
```console
python3 -m venv venv
```

Lastly, activate the new `venv`:
```console
source venv/bin/activate
```

If everything worked correctly, you should see an indication in your terminal prompt like this:
```console filename="Example terminal prompt"
(venv) ~/fides-cloud%
```

## Install Fides CLI via ```pip```

Once you've setup your virtual environment, you can install the Fides CLI via the [ethyca-fides](https://pypi.org/project/ethyca-fides/) Python package. Ensure you've activated your virtual environment (from the previous step) and then run ```pip```:
```console
pip install ethyca-fides
```

This will take a few minutes to download and install the various project dependencies. Once complete, you can use the ```fides --version``` command to test that everything is running as expected:
```console
(venv) ~/fides-cloud% fides --version
fides, version 2.25.0
```

## Connect your Fides CLI to Fides Cloud

Lastly, we need to connect your local CLI to your Fides Cloud instance. To do this, we'll create a minimal ```.fides/fides.toml``` configuration file and edit it accordingly.

First, run the following command from your ```~/fides-cloud``` project directory:
```command
mkdir .fides
cat > .fides/fides.toml << EOF
[cli]
server_host = "<YOUR_FIDES_CLOUD_HOSTNAME>" # e.g. fides-example.us.fides.ethyca.com
server_port = 443
server_protocol = "https"
EOF
```

This will create a new ```.fides/``` working directory and initialize it with a minimal ```fides.toml``` configuration file that looks like this:
```toml filename="Example fides.toml config file"
[cli]
server_host = "<YOUR_FIDES_CLOUD_HOSTNAME>" # e.g. fides-example.us.fides.ethyca.com
server_port = 443
server_protocol = "https"
```

Next, we'll replace the ```<YOUR_FIDES_CLOUD_HOSTNAME>``` variable with your own Fides Cloud hostname. For example, if you login at https://fides-example.us.fides.ethyca.com, your hostname is ```fides-example.us.fides.ethyca.com```.

Once you've found your hostname, edit the config file with your favorite editor and save your changes:
```command
open .fides/fides.toml
```

If you've done this successfully, you can check your Fides Cloud status with the ```fides status``` command and should see a success message similar to this:
```command filename="Example success message"
(venv) ~/fides-cloud% fides status
> Loaded config from: .fides/fides.toml
Getting server status...
Server is reachable and the client/server application versions match.
```

Great, you've configured your ```fides``` CLI to connect to Fides Cloud! For more advanced information about the `.fides/` directory, you can read about [initializating working directories](/dev-docs/cli/init) here.

## Login to your Fides Cloud instance

Lastly, you can login to your Fides Cloud instance using the ```fides user login``` command. This authenticates your local CLI to allow you to make edits and changes to the server.

To authenticate, run the following command and follow the prompts to enter your username and password:
```command
fides user login
```

If your credentials are correct, you should see a success message like the one below, and your credentials will be saved locally and used for future commands.
```command filename="Example login"
(venv) ~/fides-cloud% fides user login
> Loaded config from: .fides/fides.toml
Username: user@example.com
Password: 
Logged in as user: user@example.com
Credentials file written to: /Users/example/.fides_credentials
```

Congratulations! You've installed and connected the Fides CLI to your Fides Cloud instance, and can now run all the local CLI commands to interact with the Fides server.

As a next step, try running commands like ```fides ls system``` or ```fides ls dataset``` to view the System or Dataset resources you may have configured in Fides Cloud previously. Enjoy!

## Optional: Reactivating Python virtual environment

For future CLI sessions, you'll need to reactivate the Python ```venv``` to run CLI commands. You can reactivate your virtual environment at any time by switching back to the project directory and running the activate command:
```console
cd ~/fides-cloud
source venv/bin/activate
fides --version
```
