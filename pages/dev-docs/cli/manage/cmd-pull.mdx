# Command: pull

The ```fides pull``` command updates local resources in the ```.fides``` working directory to match those on the server.

When the ```pull``` command is run, it will:

1. Retrieve all remote resources by their Fides key from the Server.
2. Update local YAML resources in the working directory to match the Server versions.
