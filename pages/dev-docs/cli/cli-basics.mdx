# Basic CLI Features
The command line interface to Fides is the ```fides``` command, which accepts a variety of subcommands such as ```fides init``` or ```fides generate```.

We refer to the Fides command line tool as "Fides CLI" elsewhere in the documentation. This terminology is often used to distinguish it from other components you might use in the Fides product family, such as [Fides Server](#LINK) or the various [Fides connectors](#LINK), which are developed and released separately from Fides CLI.

To view a list of the commands available in your current Fides version, run ```fides``` with no additional arguments:

```console filename="Command Line"
Usage: fides [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

  The parent group for the Fides CLI.

Options:
  --version               Show the version and exit.
  -f,--config-path TEXT   Path to a configuration file. Use 'fides view-
                          config' to print the config. Not compatible with the
                          'fides webserver' subcommand.
  --local                 Run in 'local_mode'. This mode doesn’t make API
                          calls and can be used without the API
                          server/database.
  -h,--help               Show this message and exit.

To get specific help for any specific command, use the ```-h``` option with the relevant subcommand. For example, to see help about the "evaluate" subcommand you can run ```fides evaluate -h```.

The inline help built in to Fides CLI describes the most important characteristics of each command. For more detailed information, refer to each command's page for details.
