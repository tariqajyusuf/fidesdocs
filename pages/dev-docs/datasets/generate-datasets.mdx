# Generating a Dataset

In Fides, a [_dataset_](/dev-docs/datasets) is a YAML configuration file that describes a collection of data such as a database. Fides uses these dataset YAML files as a map of your database to automatically process privacy requests. A dataset describes where categories of personal data (e.g. user contact info) can be found and how fields in tables or collections are related to each other so that Fides can safely traverse the data when processing privacy requests.
