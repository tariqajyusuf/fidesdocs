# Annotating data categories manually
In order to process privacy requests, Fides needs to know how to find and process the applicable categories of personal data. For example, if a data subject submits a request to have their personal data removed, Fides has to know where to find categories of personal data like _user contact info_, _demographic info_, or _purchase history_. 

Fides uses metadata labels that describe each table and field in a database to indicate which fields contain personal data.

For example, if a table contains fields with _user contact data_, annotating it with the label `user.contact` from the [FidesLang Taxonomy](https://ethyca.github.io/fideslang/taxonomy/data_categories/) instructs Fides to treat this information as contact information. The screenshot below shows a database table with Fides personal data categories assigned to each field:

## Annotating data categories

You can specify the data category for each field of a collection in a Fides dataset. Read about [Fides dataset structures here](/dev-docs/datasets/structure).
To learn about [generating datasets read the guide here](/dev-docs/datasets/generate-datasets).

The dataset fields that will need to be configured are: 

| Key | Value |
|-----|-------|
| **`fides_key`** | The unique name of the dataset. |
| **`collections`** | A list of tables or collection within the database. |
| **`fields`** | The list of fields within the table or the collection. |
| **`name`** | The name of the field within the table or collection. |
| **`data_categories`** | The data category label taken from the [FidesLang Taxonomy](https://ethyca.github.io/fideslang/taxonomy/data_categories/) to describe the personal data found in this field.

The following example describes a table called `customer` within a database called `postgres_example_dataset`. This table has the fields `id`, `email`, `name` which have been appropriately labeled for privacy request processing.

```yaml filename="postgres_dataset.yml"
collections:
  - name: customer
    fields:
    - name: email
      data_categories:          # Add data categories section
      - user.contact.email      # Specify the data category (in this case email)
    - name: id
      data_categories: 
      - user.unique_id
      fides_meta:
        primary_key: True
    - name: name
      data_categories:
      - user.name
      fides_meta:
        data_type: string
        length: 40
```
