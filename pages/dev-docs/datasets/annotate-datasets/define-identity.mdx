# Dataset identity keys for privacy requests
In order for Fides to process a privacy request for a given dataset it must not which fields should be used to uniquey identify user data. Specifying an identity key for a dataset allows Fides to complete these tasks. Here we'll walk through defining an identity key for a dataset.

## Defining the identity key for the dataset
In order to use your dataset for privacy requests, you must specify an `identify key` to indicate which field Fides should use to search for records.

Expanding on our sample project, the most suitable `identity key` would be the `email` field because it is unique and identifiable. 

```yaml filename="postgres_dataset.yml"
collections:
  - name: customer
    fields:
    - name: email
      data_categories:
      - user.contact.email
      fides_meta:           # Add Fides metadata section
        identity: email     # Specify this is the identity key and provide a name
        data_type: string   # Specify the expected data type
    - name: id
      data_categories: 
      - user.unique_id
      fides_meta:
        primary_key: True
    - name: name
      data_categories:
      - user.name
      fides_meta:
        data_type: string
        length: 40
```
