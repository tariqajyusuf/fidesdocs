# Annotating datasets using the CLI

The `fides annotate` command provides a command line prompt tool to assist in labeling data categories of an existing dataset.

## Using annotate command
```console
$ fides annotate dataset .fides/<your_dataset>.yaml
> Loaded config from: /fides/.fides/fides.toml
####
Annotating Dataset: [sample_dataset]
####
Annotating Table: [user]

Field [user.id] has no data categories

Enter comma separated data categories for [id] [s: skip, q: quit]:
```

The on screen prompts will walk you through the annotation process, also allowing for you to save state if you do not complete the annotations in a single session so that you can return and complete later.
Read the [CLI guide to learn more about managing resources](/dev-docs/cli/manage).

```console
...
Enter comma separated data categories for [id] [s: skip, q: quit]: system.operations
Setting data categories for user.id to:
            ['system.operations']

Annotation process complete.
```
