# Skipping collections

The ability to skip privacy request processing on specific data collections or API endpoints can be useful in scenarios such as a data processing error, or if the collection is known to not contain personal data. 


## Configure process skipping

In order to skip a collection, use the flag `skip_processing: True` as shown in this example:

```yaml
dataset:
  - fides_key: postgres_example_dataset
    name: Postgres Example Dataset
    description: Example of a Postgres dataset containing a variety of related tables like customers, products, addresses, etc.
    collections:
      - name: address
        fides_meta:
          skip_processing: True
```

In order to skip an endpoint, use the flag `skip_processing: True` as shown in this example:

```yaml
saas_config:
  fides_key: saas_connector_example
  name: SaaS Example Config
  type: custom
  description: A sample schema representing a SaaS for Fides
  version: 0.0.1

  endpoints:
    - name: skipped_collection
      skip_processing: True
      requests:
        read:
          method: GET
          path: /v1/misc_endpoint/<list_id>
          param_values:
            - name: list_id
              references:
                - dataset: saas_connector_example
                  field: users.list_ids
                  direction: from
```
