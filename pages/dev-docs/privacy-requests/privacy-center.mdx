# The privacy center
The Fides Privacy Center is a configurable webpage where users can request to access, update, or delete their data or update their consent preferences. 

## Deploy the privacy center
<Callout emoji="" type="info">The following steps assume that you have Docker installed. For more information on how to install Docker, please see the [Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/). </Callout>

The Privacy Center is provided in a standalone Docker image called `ethyca/fides-privacy-center`. 
To deploy this image, run the following command: 
```python
docker pull ethyca/fides-privacy-center
```

The default privacy center will look something like the sample privacy center shown below:
<Screenshot img="/docs/assets/img/configuration/configuration-privacy-center-default.gif" description="The default privacy center" />

## Configure the privacy center

The Fides Privacy Center's text and actions are managed by a `config.json` file, which is located in your project's `/clients/app/config` directory. 

Within this configuration file, you may:

* [Configure which privacy request options appear](#configure-privacy-request-options)
* [Configure which consent options appear](#configure-consent-options)
* [Configure the appearance of the privacy center](#configure-appearance)


### Configure privacy request options
The list of available privacy request functions is controlled by the _Actions_ section of the configuration file. Within this section, privacy functions may be defined using the following fields:

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- | 
| `title` | Title for the tile displayed on the site that describes the function being performed. | 
| `description` | A user-friendly description for each privacy request option. | 
| `icon_path` | Specify a URL to a public icon to override the default icon displayed. | 
| `policy_key` | A key that refers to the [policy](/dev-docs/configuration/policies/request-policies) that will be used. |
| `identity_inputs` | The list of personally identifiable information gathered to perform an action and whether or not it is required. | 


#### Example: access request
This is an example of an _Access_ function that requires the Data Subject to enter their email address and executes the `default_access_policy` when submitted returning the access package to the specified email address. 

````json
"actions": [
    {
    "title": "Access your data",
    "description": "We will email you a report of the data related to your account.",

      }
    }
]
````

### Configure consent options
The list of consent notices displayed to the user and their options are controlled by the _Consent_ section of the configuration file. Within this section, consent options may be defined for the privacy center page and for the resulting consent options page.

#### For the privacy center page
These fields define how the consent tile will appear in the Privacy Center: 

| Field | Description |

| `description_subtext` | Additional, optional text you can display on the consent request modal, after the button has been clicked. |
| `icon_path` | Specify a URL to a public icon to override the default icon displayed. |
| `identity_inputs` | The list of personally identifiable information gathered to perform consent and whether or not it is required. |

| `consentOptions` | A list of consent notices that should appear on the page. | 

#### For each consent option
These fields define how each consent option will appear:

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- | 
| `fidesDataUseKey` | The [FidesLang](https://ethyca.github.io/fideslang/) `data use` that is linked to this consent option.| 
| `name` & `description` | User-friendly information about the consent option. | 
| `url` | The URL where a user can view the consent notice. | 
| `default`| If this consent preference is enabled (true) or disabled (false) by default. |

    "includeConsent": true,
    "consent": {
        "button": {
            "title": "Manage your consent",
            "description": "Manage your consent preferences",

            "description": "Manage your consent preferences, including the option to select 'Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information'.",
            "description_subtext": [
                "When you use our services, you're trusting us with your information. We understand this is a big responsibility and work hard to protect your information and put you in control."
            ],
            "policy_key": "default_consent_policy",

                    "url": "https://example.com/privacy#data-sales",
                    "default": {
                        "value": true,
                        "globalPrivacyControl": false
                    },
                    "highlight": false,
                    "cookieKeys": [
                        "data_sales_and_sharing"
                    ],
                    "executable": false
                }
            ]
        }
    }
```

### Configure appearance

To configure the appearance of your organization's privacy center, you may:
* [Set a custom Title, Description, or Logo](#set-custom-fields)
* [Configure the website's appearance with a CSS stylesheet](#configure-website-appearance)


#### Set custom fields
To configure a custom `Title`, `Description`, or `Logo`, please locate these fields in the `config.json` file found in your project's `/clients/app/config` directory and set the values accordingly:

```json
{
    "title": "Take control of your data",
    "description": "When you use our services, youâ€™re trusting us with your information. We understand this is a big responsibility and work hard to protect your information and put you in control.",
    "logo_path": "/logo.svg",
    "logo_url": "https://fid.es",
    "privacy_policy_url": "https://fid.es/privacy",
    "privacy_policy_url_text": "Privacy Policy",
} 
```
<Callout emoji="" type="info">To set a custom logo, you will have to upload the logo to somewhere publicly accessible. </Callout>

#### Configure website appearance

To configure a custom appearance for the website, you may upload a CSS Stylesheet named `config.css` to the `/privacy-center/config` directory.

### Chakra UI CSS
By default, Fides uses the [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com) framework to speed up styling. 


#### Example: customizing heading text CSS

In order to modify the heading text, Chakra has a default `chakra-heading` class style that is assigned to `h1`, `h2`, `h3`, `h4` and so on. To modify this style you can apply to all headings to specify a heading size:

```css filename="Privacy Center Heading CSS"
/* Apply changes to all headings of the site */
.chakra-heading {
    color: #0000FF; /* Set text color to blue */
    font-size: 1.5em; /* Increase font size by 50% */
    font-weight: 300; /* Lighten font weight */
}
/* Apply changes only to heading 2 <h2> */
h2.chakra-heading {
    color: #0000FF; /* Set text color to blue */
    font-size: 1.5em; /* Increase font size by 50% */
    font-weight: 300; /* Lighten font weight */
}
```
