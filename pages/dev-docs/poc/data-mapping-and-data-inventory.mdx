# POC: Data Mapping with Fides
Our POC (Proof of Concept) guides are intended for enterprise organiations evaluating Fides deployed in their environment and are a helpful way to guide you through deploying and evaluating the world's leading privacy engineering platform.

## Prerequisites Guide for AWS Data Mapping and Data Inventory
Please follow these guides, in order, for the appropriate environment to get started quickly with your Fides POC (Proof of Concept):

### In-House Systems

| Step | Description | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| AWS Provisioning | Provision AWS Credentials | [AWS Guide to provisioning Access Key](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/powershell/latest/userguide/pstools-appendix-sign-up.html) |
| SQL Database Credential Provisioning | Provision a service account for Database Access | Fides requires read-only permissions for classification. |
| Kubernetes Deployment (If Self-Deploying) | Access to deploy to AKS | [AWS Guide to setting up Helm with EKS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/helm.html) |

### Third Party SaaS

| Step | Description | Notes |
