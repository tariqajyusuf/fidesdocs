# Connect to SaaS Applications

## What is a SaaS integration?


A Fides SaaS (Software as a Service) Integration allows a user to connect to a third-party application (e.g., Mailchimp, Stripe, Hubspot), and execute data access and erasure requests against that application. Fides represents your SaaS connections as a [Dataset](/user-guides/integrations/database-integrations/datasets), accessed via a [Connection](/docs/databases/database-connections), and configured by a [SaaS config](/docs/connectors/saas-config).

## Supported SaaS applications

The current implementation of the SaaS framework can support any SaaS application that uses these features:

- Basic auth, bearer auth, OAuth2 (Authorization Code Flow)
- Data access via HTTP requests
- Erasure via HTTP requests
- Pagination based on headers and response contents

The following features are planned for future releases and will allow for the configuration of broader types of connections:

- Custom Python functions for access and erasure requests
- Retry logic based on status codes and response contents


For full examples of supported Integrations, see the [example configurations](/docs/connectors/example-connectors/adobe).

## Configure a SaaS Integration

When running the Fides webserver, you may navigate to the interactive API docs at `http://{server_url}/docs` (e.g., `http://0.0.0.0:8080/docs`) to access the following endpoints.


### Create a [Connection](/docs/databases/database-connections) of type `saas`

```json filename="PATCH /api/v1/connection"
[
  {
    "name": "SaaS Application",
    "key": {saas_key},
    "connection_type": "saas",
    "access": "read"
  }
]
```

### Add a SaaS Config (in JSON format)

```json filename="PATCH /api/v1/connection/{saas_key}/saas_config"
{
    "fides_key": "mailchimp_connector_example",
    "name": "Mailchimp SaaS Config",
    "type": "mailchimp",
    "description": "A sample schema representing the Mailchimp integration for fides"
    ...
```

### Configure your secrets

```json filename="PUT /api/v1/connection/{saas_key}/secret"
{
  "domain": "{mailchimp_domain}",
  "username": "{mailchimp_username}",
  "api_key": "{mailchimp_api_key}"
}
```

### Add a Dataset (in JSON format)

```json filename="PUT /api/v1/connection/{saas_key}/dataset"
[
  {
    "fides_key":"mailchimp_connector_example",
    "name":"Mailchimp Dataset",
    "description":"A sample dataset representing the Mailchimp connector for fidesops",
    "collections":[
      {
        "name":"messages"
    ...
```

## Additional considerations

The following constraints are enforced by the API validation:

1. A SaaS Integration dataset cannot have any `identities` or `references` in the `fidesops_meta`. These relationships must be defined in the [SaaS config](./saas-config).
2. SaaS config references can only have a direction of `from`.
3. The `fides_key` between the SaaS config and the Dataset must match in order to be associated.

## Set up a SaaS integration from a template

To create all the resources necessary to set up a SaaS Integration in one request, you can create an integration from
a template. This creates a `saas` Integration with your supplied name and description, using your supplied `secrets`.


The example below creates a [mailchimp](/docs/connectors/example-connectors/mailchimp) saas connector, and would need the relevant mailchimp `secrets`.

Your `instance_key` will become the identifier for the related [Dataset](/user-guides/integrations/database-integrations/datasets). By default, the saas connection config is enabled with write access.

```json filename="POST /connection/instantiate/mailchimp"
{
    "name": "My Mailchimp integration",
    "description": "Production Mailchimp Instance",
    "secrets": {
        "domain": "{{mailchimp_domain}}",
        "api_key": "{{mailchimp_api_key}}",
        "username": "{{mailchimp_username}}"
    },
    "instance_key": "primary_mailchimp",
}
```
