# API: Authenticating via OAuth

The `/api/v1/oauth` routes are a collection of routes that are used to handle Authentication and Authorization within your Fides environment. 

Fides' API supports the ` OAuth2 Client Credentials Grant` which requires to you create a `Client ID` and `Secret` with a specified set of scopes. 

If you are self-deploying and not using [Fides Cloud](https://ethyca.com/book-demo?utm_source=docsiteapidocs), you might recall that you created a Root OAuth Client ID and Client Secret, however, like any good security oriented company, we strongly recommend you do not use Root credentials for day-to-day tasks. Use the Root Credentials to create a new Client ID/Secret pair with limited scopes using the endpoint below.

If you are using Fides Cloud, reach out to your Customer Success Manager and they will provide the initial OAuth token to create additional tokens.
