# Project Requirements

<Callout emoji="â“˜">Want to quickly experiment with Fides? Use the [demo application](/dev-docs/get-started) to go from "Zero to DSR Automation" in minutes!</Callout>

## System requirements 

Fides consists of the following individual systems:

* **Hosted Database**: A PostgreSQL database server used for permanent storage of configuration data for the webserver.
* **Hosted Cache**: A Redis database server used as a temporary cache during execution and task scheduling.
* **Fides Webserver**: The main application, which houses the Admin UI and API endpoints.

Production deployments may require a storage destination to store the results of completed privacy requests and the Privacy Center can be deployed as a pre-built and customizable portal for receiving privacy requests.

Read about [configuring storage destinations](/dev-docs/configuration/privacy-requests/storage-destinations) here and [configuring the privacy center](/guides/privacy-center) here.

Fides requires a general purpose web server (e.g. for AWS EC2, a t3.small), and has no persistent storage requirements.

## Version requirements

Fides supports the following Python versions:

* Python: 3.8+

The following is supported as the application database:

* PostgreSQL: 12

The following is supported as the application cache:

* Redis: 6.2.0+

All of these must be installed, either locally or via Docker, before attempting to run Fides as an application. The CLI is capable of running with only the Python dependency.

## Docker requirements

If using Docker, the following minimum versions are required:

* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop): 20.10.11+
