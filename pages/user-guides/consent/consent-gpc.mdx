# Consent Management: Global Privacy Control (GPC)

## What is the Global Privacy Control (GPC)?
Global Privacy Control (GPC) is a technical specification for transmitting an opt-out request directly from a user’s browser.

The GPC specification was originally conceived to simplify the ability for a consumer to enforce their rights to opt-out of the processing or sharing of their personal data. However, it has had widespread global adoption, and as such, today, depending on the jurisdiction of the consumer, their GPC opt-out signal may refer to processing, or sale of personal information and more generally advertising.

The GPC works by setting a value on the user’s browser that is signaled to websites when the user navigates to them so that a site can immediately recognize the users privacy preferences without the need to ask them in advance.
