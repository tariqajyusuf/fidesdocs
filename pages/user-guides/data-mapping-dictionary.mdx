### Retrieve data use and cookie information
Compass contains a comprehensive list of business purposes for each vendor describing which types of personal data are collected, complete with commonly used legal bases, data categories, cookies, and other relevant information. 

To retrieve these suggestions for a new system, please:

1. Click on the **Data uses** tab
2. Click on the button titled **Generate data uses automatically**
3. Pick the data uses that you want to populate or choose **Accept all** to populate all of them

2. Click on the system to enter its information portal
3. Click on the **Data uses** tab
4. Click the Fides Compass button
5. Pick the data uses that you want to populate or choose **Accept all** to populate all of them

Next you will learn to visualize, [filter and build reports such as a RoPA (Record of Processing Activities)](./data-mapping-reports).
