# Manage integrations using the UI
<TutorialKey duration="4" product="Fides" topic="Integrations" video="true" interactive="true"/>

<Callout emoji="ⓘ">Fides recently deprecated the _Connection Manager_ UI. For steps to migrate your connectors to system integrations, please see the [Migrate from the Connection manager section](#migrate-from-the-connection-manager).</Callout>

To integrate with a new system, you must first follow the steps to [add a system to the data map](../tutorials/data-mapping-get-started).

## Integrate with an existing system 

To integrate with a system that's already in your data map:

1. Navigate to **Data map** → **View Systems** and choose the system that you want to connect to
2. Click on the **Integrations** tab.
3. Pick the vendor or system type that you want to integrate with from the **Connection type** drop-down menu.
4. Complete the required fields for the integration and click **Save**. 

You may confirm your connection is working using the **Test connection** button, if desired.

Details about each field in the template are available in the vendor guides:
* [SaaS vendor guides](saas-integrations/saas-configs)
* [Database vendor guides](databases/db-configs)

Some systems require that you authenticate using OAuth2. Our guide for doing this is _coming soon_ but please reach out in the meantime for assistance.

If you are working with a database, you will need to configure a dataset. To learn more, please see our guide for [Managing datasets](databases/datasets).

## Enable or disable an integration
_Coming soon!_ 

## Delete an integration
To delete an integration:

1. Navigate to **Data map** → **View Systems** and choose the system that you want to delete the integration from. 
2. Click on the **Integrations** tab.
3. Scroll to the bottom of the form and click **Delete**.

## Upload a connector template

To add a new custom integration, use the **Upload connector** button. This will open a modal where you can upload a custom connector template in the form of a _Zip_ file:

Steps for creating a custom config can be found in the [Custom connector templates](saas-integrations/custom-config/custom-template) guide.

## Migrate from the Connection manager

Fides recently moved from supporting standalone connectors to treating connectors as System Integrations. To ease the migration to the new system, the **Connection manager** UI will remain accessible as long as there are unlinked connectors available. 

To link a connector to a system:

1. Navigate to **Data map** → **View Systems** and choose the system that you want to link a connector to. 
2. Click on the **Integrations** tab.
3. Click **Link connector**.
4. Select the connection from the list of unlinked connections.
5. Click **Link connector**
6. Click **Save**

This connector will no longer appear in the **Connection manager** UI.
