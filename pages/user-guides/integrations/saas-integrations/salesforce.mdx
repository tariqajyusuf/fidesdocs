# Salesforce
[Salesforce](https://www.salesforce.com/) is a cloud-based customer relationship management (CRM) platform that helps businesses manage sales, marketing, and customer service interactions in a unified system..

## Prerequisites

<Callout emoji="" type="info" title="Connected apps"> To integrate with Salesforce, we require our customers to use a _Connected App_. This ensures exclusive data control, enhances security by reducing unauthorized access risks, and allows customization of scopes and permissions to suit your business needs and policies.</Callout>

To configure a Connected App, please follow this [Salesforce guide](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.connected_app_create.htm&type=5) and complete the following steps, at minimum:
1. Configure Basic Connected App Settings
2. Enable OAuth Settings for API Integration including assigning, at least, the scope for `Manage user data via APIs` to your connected app for API access.
3. Enter the callback URL using your Fides Redirect URL (typically `https://fides-host.com/api/v1/oauth/callback`)


Once you have this configured, you'll need to collect the following information:

| Name                       | Description                                                                                                                             |
| :------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Domain***                | Your Salesforce URL. To find this, please follow the Salesforce guide for [viewing instance information](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=000384755&type=1).  |
| **Consumer Key***             | Your OAuth client ID. Follow Salesforce's docs to retrive your [OAuth credentials](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.connected_app_rotate_consumer_details.htm) |
| **Consumer Secret***         | Your OAuth client secret. Follow Salesforce's docs to retrive your [OAuth credentials](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.connected_app_rotate_consumer_details.htm) |
| **Redirect URL***           | The Fides URL to which users will be redirected upon successful authentication (ex. `https://fides-host.com/api/v1/oauth/callback`) |

<Callout emoji="" type="info" title="Redirect/Callback URL is case sensitive">The callback/redirect URL is case sensitive. Please be sure to validate this URL during implementation time.</Callout>

## Integrating with Salesforce
To integrate an existing system with Salesforce:

1. Navigate to **Data map** → **View Systems** and choose the system that you want to connect.
2. Click on the **Integrations** tab.
3. Pick the vendor or system type that you want to integrate with from the **Connection type** drop-down menu.
4. Complete the required fields for the integration and click **Save**.

To authorize the integration so that it can connect to Salesforce:
1. Click on **Authorize integration** to be redirected to the Salesforce authorization screen
2. Enter your Salesforce credentials and click **Log in**. You will automatically be redirected back to the Fides UI using the `Redirect URL` that was provided in the form in the previous step.

You may now confirm your connection is working using the **Test connection** button, if desired.

To learn more, please see our guide for [Managing Integrations](/user-guides/integrations/manage-integrations).

## Technical detail 

Fides utilizes _API endpoints_ to access the _API service_ for a SaaS application. An _API service_ is the programmatic interface through which Fides can query and update data within an application to access, rectify, or delete personal information. Each SaaS tool will have a unique set of endpoints to enable privacy functions. 

### Salesforce endpoints
In the table below, you can find which endpoints are used for each type of privacy function. Clicking on the endpoint will take you to the documentation for that endpoint.

| Privacy function | Endpoint | Description |
