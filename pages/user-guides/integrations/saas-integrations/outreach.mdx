In order to [integrate](../) with Outreach, you'll first need to follow [Outreach's instructions](https://developers.outreach.io/client-extensions/your-first-outreach-extension/) to create a custom app using OAuth 2.0. Once the custom app is created, you will need to collect the following information:
| Name                       | Description                                                                                                                             |
| :------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Domain***                 | The domain used for API calls to your Outreach custom app. This value  is always `api.outreach.io`. |
| **Requester Email***           | The email address of the Outreach user that created your custom app. |
| **Application ID***              | The application ID of your Outreach custom app. This is also sometimes referred to as the OAuth client ID. |
| **Application Secret***          | The application secret of your Outreach custom app. This is also sometimes referred to as the OAuth client secret. |
| **Callback URL***            | The callback URL of your custom Outreach app. This is also sometimes referred to as the OAuth redirect URI. |
| **Page Size***            | The number of results to return on each page. |

## Technical detail 

Fides utilizes _API endpoints_ to access the _API service_ for a SaaS application. An _API service_ is the programmatic interface through which Fides can query and update data within an application to access, rectify, or delete personal information. Each SaaS tool will have a unique set of endpoints to enable privacy functions. 

### Outeach Endpoints
In the table below, you can find which endpoints are used for each type of privacy function. Clicking on the endpoint will take you to the documentation for that endpoint.

| Privacy function | Endpoint(s) | Description |
|----|----|----|
| **Access Requests** | [Prospects](https://developers.outreach.io/api/reference/tag/Prospect/) | Used to fetch prospects from Outreach. | 
| **Access Requests** | [Recipients](https://developers.outreach.io/api/reference/tag/Recipient/) | Used to fetch recipients from Outreach. |
| **Delete Requests** | [Prospects, Recipients](https://developers.outreach.io/api/reference/tag/Compliance-Request/) | Used to delete prospects and recipients in Outreach. |

By default, deletion requests are fulfilled by masking personal information. To enable Fides to erase personal information instead of just masking it, ensure the `masking_strict` variable in your `fides.toml` file is set to `false`.
