# SaaS integrations

An _Integration_ connects Fides to your [databases](/user-guides/integrations/databases) and [third-party SaaS applications](/user-guides/integrations/saas-integrations), allowing Fides to execute [privacy requests](../privacy-requests) against all data in your organization.

To learn how to configure integrations, please see our guide for [Managing integrations](manage-integrations).

Currently, Fides offers supported integrations for commonly used databases such as [PostgreSQL](/user-guides/integrations/databases/postgresql), [BigQuery](/user-guides/integrations/databases/bigquery), and [Snowflake](/user-guides/integrations/databases/snowflake), as well as popular SaaS applications including [Adobe Campaign](/user-guides/integrations/saas-integrations/adobe-campaign) and Google Analytics, among many others! To view the list of currently supported vendors, please refer to the [Supported integrations](#supported_database_integrations) section below.

We're constantly adding new integrations and you can request additional integrations from your customer support team!
