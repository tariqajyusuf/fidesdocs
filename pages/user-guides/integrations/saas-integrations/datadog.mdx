# Datadog
[Datadog](https://business.adobe.com/products/campaign/adobe-campaign.html) is a cloud-based monitoring and analytics platform that provides real-time visibility into the performance of applications, infrastructure, and cloud services. 

## Prerequisites

In order to [integrate](../) with Datadog, you'll need to collect the following information:

| Name                       | Description                                                                                                                             |
| :------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Domain***                 | The domain used for API calls to the Datadog site hosting your account. For the US1 site this is `api.datadoghq.com`, but if your site is not US1 you will need to identify the appropriate site parameter in Datadog's table [here](https://docs.datadoghq.com/getting_started/site/#access-the-datadog-site) and append this to `api.` for your domain value. For example, the site parameter for US5 Datadog site is `us5.datadog.com` so the correct domain value to use in Fides is `api.us5.datadog.com` .  |
| **API Key***        | The API key for your Datadog organization that you wish to use with Fides. Follow [Datadog's docs](https://docs.datadoghq.com/account_management/api-app-keys/#api-keys) to generate an API key. |
| **Application Key***   | The application key for your Datadog organization that you wish to use with Fides. Note that application keys should not be confused with API keys, they are not the same. Follow [Datadog's docs](https://docs.datadoghq.com/account_management/api-app-keys/#application-keys) to generate an application key. |

## Integrating with Datadog
To integrate an existing system with Datadog: 

1. Navigate to **Data map** â†’ **View Systems** and choose the system that you want to connect.
2. Click on the **Integrations** tab.
3. Pick the vendor or system type that you want to integrate with from the **Connection type** drop-down menu.

## Technical detail 

Fides utilizes _API endpoints_ to access the _API service_ for a SaaS application. An _API service_ is the programmatic interface through which Fides can query and update data within an application to access, rectify, or delete personal information. Each SaaS tool will have a unique set of endpoints to enable privacy functions. 

### Datadog Endpoints
In the table below, you can find which endpoints are used for each type of privacy function. Clicking on the endpoint will take you to the documentation for that endpoint.

| Privacy function | Endpoint | Description |
|----|----|----|
| **Access Requests** | [Logs](https://docs.datadoghq.com/api/latest/logs/#get-a-list-of-logs) | Used to search and fetch logs. |
