## Technical detail 

Fides utilizes _API endpoints_ to access the _API service_ for a SaaS application. An _API service_ is the programmatic interface through which Fides can query and update data within an application to access, rectify, or delete personal information. Each SaaS tool will have a unique set of endpoints to enable privacy functions. 

### Stripe endpoints
