## Technical detail

Fides utilizes _API endpoints_ to access the _API service_ for a SaaS application. An _API service_ is the programmatic interface through which Fides can query and update data within an application to access, rectify, or delete personal information. Each SaaS tool will have a unique set of endpoints to enable privacy functions.

### Unbounce Endpoints

In the table below, you can find which endpoints are used for each type of privacy function. Clicking on the endpoint will take you to the documentation for that endpoint.

| Privacy function            | Endpoint                                                                                                | Description                                                  |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Access** | [Accounts Pages](https://developer.unbounce.com/api_reference/#id_accounts__account_id__pages) | Retrieve a list of all pages for the specified account. |
| **Access** | [Pages Lead ID](https://developer.unbounce.com/api_reference/#id_pages__page_id__leads__lead_id_) | Get info of single Lead. |
| **Erasure**| [Pages Lead Deletion](https://developer.unbounce.com/api_reference/#id_pages__page_id__lead_deletion_request) | Creates a request to asynchronously delete one or more leads for a given page. NOTE: this endpoint cannot be used with API keys (OAuth only) |

<Callout type="info" emoji="">
By default, deletion requests are fulfilled by masking personal information. To enable Fides to personal information, ensure the `masking_strict` variable in your `fides.toml` file is set to `false`.
