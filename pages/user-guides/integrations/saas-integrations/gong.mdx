## Technical detail

Fides utilizes _API endpoints_ to access the _API service_ for a SaaS application. An _API service_ is the programmatic interface through which Fides can query and update data within an application to access, rectify, or delete personal information. Each SaaS tool will have a unique set of endpoints to enable privacy functions.

### Gong Endpoints

In the table below, you can find which endpoints are used for each type of privacy function. Clicking on the endpoint will take you to the documentation for that endpoint.

| Privacy function    | Endpoint                                                                                     | Description                                                                                     |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Access Requests** | [Retrieve all references to an email address](https://app.gong.io/settings/api/documentation#get-/v2/data-privacy/data-for-email-address)        | Shows the elements in the Gong system that reference the given email address. Given an emails address, this endpoint returns details of all calls and email messages that reference this address, and any leads or contacts with this email address.|
| **Delete Requests** | [Delete the email address, and all associated elements](https://app.gong.io/settings/api/documentation#post-/v2/data-privacy/erase-data-for-email-address) | Given an email address, this endpoint deletes from the Gong system any calls or email messages that reference this address.                                                                  |

<Callout type="info" emoji="">
By default, deletion requests are fulfilled by masking personal information. To enable Fides to personal information, ensure the `masking_strict` variable in your `fides.toml` file is set to `false`.
