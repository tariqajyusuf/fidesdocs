# Google Analytics 4
[Google Analytics 4](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/ga4) is a web analytics service that helps companies track and analyze website performance and user behavior.

## Prerequisites
<Callout emoji="" type="info">OAuth 2.0 must be configured ahead of time to authorize requests against this service. To learn more follow [this guide from Google Analytics](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/core/v4/authorization). </Callout>


In order to [integrate](/docs/user-guides/integrations) with Google Analytics 4, you must complete the following steps:
* Enable authorization using [Google OAuth 2.0](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/core/v4/authorization).
* Configure the Google OAuth Consent Screen and add  the `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/analytics.user.deletion` scope to your app. Steps for this can be found in the *User Consent* section of [this guide](https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/6158849?hl=en#zippy=%2Cpublic-and-internal-applications). 

Once you have this configured, you'll need to collect the following information:


| Name                       | Description                                                                                                                             |
| :------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Client ID***             | The OAuth 2.0 client ID for your application.  See Google docs for creating [OAuth client ID credentials](https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/create-credentials#oauth-client-id) |
| **Client secret***         | The OAuth 2.0 client secret. See Google docs for creating [OAuth client ID credentials](https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/create-credentials#oauth-client-id) |
| **Redirect URL***           | The Fides URL to which users will be redirected upon successful authentication (ex. `https://fides-host.com/oauth/callback`) |
| **Property ID***           | Your GA4 Property ID. See Google's guide on [Property ID's](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/data/v1/property-id).  |

## Integrating with Google Analytics
To integrate an existing system with Google Analytics:

1. Navigate to **Data map** → **View Systems** and choose the system that you want to connect.
2. Click on the **Integrations** tab.
3. Pick the vendor or system type that you want to integrate with from the **Connection type** drop-down menu.
4. Complete the required fields for the integration and click **Save**.

To authorize the integration so that it can connect to Google:
1. Click on **Authorize integration** to be redirected to the Google authorization screen
2. Enter your credentials and click **Log in**. You will automatically be redirected back to the Fides UI using the `Redirect URL` that was provided in the form in the previous step.

You may now confirm your connection is working using the **Test connection** button, if desired.

To learn more, please see our guide for [Managing Integrations](/docs/user-guides/integrations/manage-integrations).

## Technical detail

Fides utilizes _API endpoints_ to access the _API service_ for a SaaS application. An _API service_ is the programmatic interface through which Fides can query and update data within an application to access, rectify, or delete personal information. Each SaaS tool will have a unique set of endpoints to enable privacy functions.

### Google Analytics Endpoints
In the table below, you can find which endpoints are used for each type of privacy function. Clicking on the endpoint will take you to the documentation for that endpoint.

| Privacy function | Endpoint | Description |
|----|----|----|
| **Consent Requests** | [User Deletion Request](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/config/userdeletion/v3/reference/userDeletion/userDeletionRequest/upsert) | Used to delete the user from Google Analytics upon opt-out |
