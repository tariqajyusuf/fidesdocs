# JIRA
[Atlassian JIRA Software](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira) is a project management tool that provides issue tracking, bug tracking, and agile project management capabilities for teams.

## Prerequisites

In order to integrate with JIRA, you'll need a JIRA admin to collect the following information:

- `Domain`: The full domain name registered when your organization set up JIRA for the first time e.g. `your-domain.atlassian.net`. This can typically be found by logging into your JIRA instance and checking the URL in your browser's address bar. 
- `Username`: The email address of the JIRA admin generating an API token. This can be found by clicking on the JIRA admin's profile image while logged into JIRA.
- The `API token` used for basic authentication to the JIRA REST API. This can be generated by a JIRA admin by following Atlassian's instructions [here](https://support.atlassian.com/atlassian-account/docs/manage-api-tokens-for-your-atlassian-account/).   


## Integrating with JIRA
To integrate an existing system with JIRA: 

1. Navigate to **Data map** â†’ **View Systems** and choose the system that you want to connect to
2. Click on the **Integrations** tab.
3. Pick the vendor or system type that you want to integrate with from the **Connection type** drop-down menu.
4. Complete the required fields for the integration and click **Save**. 

You may confirm your connection is working using the **Test connection** button, if desired.

To learn more, please see our guide for [Managing Integrations](/user-guides/integrations/manage-integrations).

## Technical detail 

Fides utilizes _API endpoints_ to access the _API service_ for a SaaS application. An _API service_ is the programmatic interface through which Fides can query and update data within an application to access, rectify, or delete personal information.

### JIRA Endpoints
Below, you will find a description of the supported endpoints and their corresponding support for privacy functions.

|Endpoint | Right to Access | Right to Delete |
|----|----|----|
|[Find Users](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/rest/v3/api-group-user-search/#api-rest-api-3-user-search-get) | Yes | No |
|[Delete User](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/rest/v3/api-group-users/#api-rest-api-3-user-delete) | No | Yes |


<Callout type="info" emoji="">
By default, deletion requests are fulfilled by masking personal information. To enable Fides to erase personal information instead of just masking it, ensure the `masking_strict` variable in your `fides.toml` file is set to `false`.
