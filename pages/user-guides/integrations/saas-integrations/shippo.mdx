## Technical detail 

Fides utilizes _API endpoints_ to access the _API service_ for a SaaS application. An _API service_ is the programmatic interface through which Fides can query and update data within an application to access, rectify, or delete personal information. Each SaaS tool will have a unique set of endpoints to enable privacy functions. 

### Shippo endpoints
In the table below, you can find which endpoints are used for each type of privacy function. Clicking on the endpoint will take you to the documentation for that endpoint.

| Privacy function | Endpoint | Description |
|----|----|----|
| **Access Requests**            | [Address](https://goshippo.com/docs/reference#addresses-list) | Returns information about a customer's address |
| **Access Requests**            | [Orders](https://goshippo.com/docs/reference#orders-list)     | Returns information about a customer's order |
