# PostgreSQL

<Callout emoji=""> This Integration requires Fides Cloud or Fides Enterprise. For more information, [talk to our solutions team.](https://ethyca.com/book-demo?utm_source=docs-site) </Callout>

[PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) is a powerful open-source object-relational database management system (ORDBMS) known for its robustness, extensibility, and adherence to SQL standards.

## Prerequisites
In order to integrate with PostgreSQL, you'll need to collect the following information from the database adminstrator:

- `Host`: The hostname or IP address of the server where the database is running.
- `Port`: The network port number on which the server is listening for incoming connections (default: 3306).
- `Username`: The user account used to authenticate and access the database.
- `Password`: The password used to authenticate and access the database.

You may optionally configure the following information:
- `Database`: The name of the specific database within the database server that you want to connect to.
- `Schema`: The default schema to be used for the database connection (defaults to public).


## Integrating with PostgreSQL
To integrate an existing system with PostgreSQL: 

1. Navigate to **Data map** → **View Systems** and choose the system that you want to connect to
2. Click on the **Integrations** tab.
3. Pick the vendor or system type that you want to integrate with from the **Connection type** drop-down menu.
4. Complete the required fields for the integration and click **Save**. 

You may confirm your connection is working using the **Test connection** button, if desired.

To learn more, please see our guide for [Managing Integrations](/user-guides/integrations/manage-integrations).

## Configuring a dataset
A dataset is required to configure an integration to this database. A dataset is a configuration file that tell Fides how to query and update data in the database. To learn more about how to create and manage datasets, please see our [Managing datasets](/user-guides/datasets) guide.

An example PostgreSQL dataset can be viewed in [Github](https://github.com/ethyca/fides/blob/main/data/dataset/postgres_example_test_dataset.yml).
