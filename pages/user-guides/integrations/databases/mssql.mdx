# MS SQL Server
[MS SQL Server](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/), also known as Microsoft SQL Server, is a comprehensive relational database management system (RDBMS) developed by Microsoft, offering enterprise-level features, robust performance, and seamless integration with other Microsoft products and technologies.

## Prerequisites
In order to integrate with MS SQL Server, you'll need to collect the following information from the database adminstrator:

- `Host`: The hostname or IP address of the server where the database is running.
- `Port`: The network port number on which the server is listening for incoming connections (default: 3306).
- `Username`: The user account used to authenticate and access the database.
- `Password`: The password used to authenticate and access the database.

You may optionally configure the following information:
- `Database`: The name of the specific database within the database server that you want to connect to.


## Integrating with MS SQL Server
To integrate an existing system with MS SQL Server: 

1. Navigate to **Data map** â†’ **View Systems** and choose the system that you want to connect to
2. Click on the **Integrations** tab.
3. Pick the vendor or system type that you want to integrate with from the **Connection type** drop-down menu.
4. Complete the required fields for the integration and click **Save**. 

You may confirm your connection is working using the **Test connection** button, if desired.

To learn more, please see our guide for [Managing Integrations](/user-guides/integrations/manage-integrations).

## Configuring a dataset
A dataset is required to configure an integration to this database. A dataset is a configuration file that tell Fides how to query and update data in the database. To learn more about how to create and manage datasets, please see our [Managing datasets](/user-guides/datasets) guide.

An example MS SQL Server dataset can be viewed in [Github](https://github.com/ethyca/fides/blob/main/data/dataset/mssql_example_test_dataset.yml).
