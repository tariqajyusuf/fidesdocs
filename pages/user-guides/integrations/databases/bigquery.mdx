# Google BigQuery
[Google BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/) is a fully managed, highly scalable, and serverless data warehouse and analytics platform that enables organizations to store, query, and analyze massive amounts of data with ease.

## Prerequisites
In order to integrate with Google BigQuery, you'll need to download or copy a `Service Account Key` file. 

To find this file, please:
1. Log into the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
2. Navigate to `IAM & Admin` → `Service Accounts` and locate an account with appropriate permissions.
3. In the `Actions` column for the account, click on the three dots icon (⋮) and select `Manage keys`.
4. Create a new key (JSON) for use with Fides and the key file will be downloaded to your computer.
5. Open the file and copy the contents to paste into the integration form.


## Integrating with Google BigQuery
To integrate an existing system with Google BigQuery: 

1. Navigate to **Data map** → **View Systems** and choose the system that you want to connect to
2. Click on the **Integrations** tab.
3. Pick the vendor or system type that you want to integrate with from the **Connection type** drop-down menu.
4. Complete the required fields for the integration and click **Save**. 

You may confirm your connection is working using the **Test connection** button, if desired.

To learn more, please see our guide for [Managing Integrations](/user-guides/integrations/manage-integrations).

## Configuring a dataset
A dataset is required to configure an integration to this database. A dataset is a configuration file that tell Fides how to query and update data in the database. To learn more about how to create and manage datasets, please see our [Managing datasets](/user-guides/integrations/manage-datasets) guide.

An example BigQuery dataset can be viewed in [Github](https://github.com/ethyca/fides/blob/main/data/dataset/bigquery_example_test_dataset.yml).
