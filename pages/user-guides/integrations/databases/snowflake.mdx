# Snowflake 

<Callout emoji=""> This Integration requires Fides Cloud or Fides Enterprise. For more information, [talk to our solutions team.](https://ethyca.com/book-demo?utm_source=docs-site) </Callout>

[Snowflake](https://www.snowflake.com/en/) is a cloud-based data platform that provides a highly scalable and fully managed solution for storing, processing, and analyzing large volumes of structured and semi-structured data.

## Prerequisites
In order to integrate with Snowflake, you'll need to collect the following information from the database adminstrator:
- `Account name`: The unique identifier for your Snowflake account.
- `Username`: The username for your Snowflake account.
- `Password`: The password associated with the Snowflake account user.


You may optionally configure the following information:
- `Warehouse`: The name of the Snowflake warehouse where your queries will be executed. If not provided, Snowflake will use the default warehouse.
- `Database`: The name of the Snowflake database you want to connect to. If not specified, Snowflake will use the default database.
- `Schema`: The name of the Snowflake schema within the selected database. If not provided, the default schema will be used.
- `Role`: The Snowflake role to assume for the session. If not specified, the default role for the user will be used.


## Integrating with Snowflake
To integrate an existing system with Snowflake: 

1. Navigate to **Data map** â†’ **View Systems** and choose the system that you want to connect to
2. Click on the **Integrations** tab.
3. Pick the vendor or system type that you want to integrate with from the **Connection type** drop-down menu.
4. Complete the required fields for the integration and click **Save**. 

You may confirm your connection is working using the **Test connection** button, if desired.

To learn more, please see our guide for [Managing Integrations](/user-guides/integrations/manage-integrations).

## Configuring a dataset
A dataset is required to configure an integration to this database. A dataset is a configuration file that tell Fides how to query and update data in the database. To learn more about how to create and manage datasets, please see our [Managing datasets](/dev-docs/datasets) guide.

An example Snowflake dataset can be viewed in [Github](https://github.com/ethyca/fides/blob/main/data/dataset/snowflake_example_test_dataset.yml)
