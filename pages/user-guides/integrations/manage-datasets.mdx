# Datasets 

In this section, we will explore _Datasets_ which are an essential component for integrating with datastores like [databases](databases). 

## What is a dataset?

A _Dataset_ is a configuration file that you provide when integrating with a database that defines how Fides should interact with your data. 

Within this configuration file, the following pieces of critical information are defined:

- `Table or collection schemas`: the list of fields inside tables or collections that exist within the database so that Fides can construct the appropriate queries for DSR privacy request execution.
- `Relationship mappings`:  so that Fides knows how to traverse the data and fulfill privacy requests
- `Advanced configuration parameters`: metadata that allows you to fine-tune your organizations's DSR privacy request execution.

## How to manage a dataset in the UI

Datasets are required when creating an integration to a system in your data map. Datasets can be linked to database integrations in a few ways:

### 1. Creating a new dataset using the dataset editor

When creating a new [database integration](manage-integrations#3-configure-the-connection-information-and-test-the-integration), you may create a new dataset using our _dataset editor_ by:
1. Clicking on the editor icon.
2. Pasting or typing in the YAML configuration.

You may edit an existing dataset at any time by returning to the database integation and selecting the dataset editor icon.


### 2. Linking an existing dataset to a database integration
When creating or editing a database integration, you may link the integration to an existing dataset by selecting the appropriate dataset from the drop-down menu.
