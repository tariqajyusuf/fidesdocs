# Integrations

## What is an integration?

An _Integration_ connects your [databases](./integrations/databases) and [third-party applications](./integrations/saas-integrations) to Fides, allowing Fides to [execute privacy requests](../TODO:link_to_privacy_requests) against all data in your organization.
We're constantly adding new integrations and you can request additional integrations from your customer support team!

To learn more about our integration types, please visit the dedicated sections of our docs:
- [Third-party SaaS integrations](./integrations/saas-integrations)
- [Database integrations](./integrations/databases)
