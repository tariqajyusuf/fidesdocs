# Datasets
In this section, we will explore _Datasets_ which are an essential component for integrating with datastores like [databases](/user-guides/integrations/databases) to process privacy requests.

# What are datasets?
A dataset is a configuration file that is linked to an [_Integration_](/user-guides/integrations) and describes, to Fides, how to interact with your databases for the purpose of processing privacy requests. A dataset describes where categories of personal data (e.g. user contact info) can be found and how fields in tables or collections are related so that Fides can traverse the data to fulfill privacy requests

The following pieces of information are defined in a dataset configuration:
- **Table schemas**: the schema, or list of fields, for the database tables or collections.
- **Data categories**: which categories of personal data exist and within which fields.
- **Identity keys**: where to search for indivdual records when procesing privacy requests.


## How to manage datasets
The following guides will get you started quickly with generating, annotating, and linking the datasets that you need in order to process privacy requests:

### Generating datasets
To generate a dataset, you may use our _Dataset editor_ or upload an existing dataset configuration file. Learn more in our guide for [Generating datasets](/user-guides/datasets/generate-datasets).

### Annotating datasets
Annotating datasets is the process of describing, to Fides, where categories of personal data (e.g. user contact info) can be found and how fields in tables or collections are related so that Fides can traverse the data to fulfill privacy requests. Learn more in our guide for [Annotating datasets](/user-guides/datasets/annotate-datasets).

### Linking datasets
To process privacy requests against databases, a dataset must be generated, annotated, and linked to the [database integration](/user-guides/integrations).  Learn more in our guide for [Linking datasets](/user-guides/datasets/link-datasets).
