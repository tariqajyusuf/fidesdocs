# Annotating Datasets

In this guide, we will explore the process of annotating datasets which involves describing, to Fides, where categories of personal data (e.g. user contact info) can be found and how fields in tables or collections are related so that Fides can traverse the data to fulfill privacy requests. 

## Annotating data categories
In order to process privacy requests, Fides needs to know how to find and process the applicable categories of personal data. For example, if a data subject submits a request to have their personal data removed, Fides has to know where to find categories of personal data like _user contact info_, _demographic info_, or _purchase history_. 

The way we instruct Fides to locate this data is to attach labels to fields in your database tables to indicate where a particular type of personal data can be found. 

For example, if you have a table with fields that contain _user contact data_, you'd label them with elements from the `user.contact` branch of the [FidesLang Taxonomy](https://ethyca.github.io/fideslang/taxonomy/data_categories/) as such:

Datasets may be annotated manually or using FidesClassify to automate the annotation. 

### Annotating categories using the UI

To annotate a dataset using the UI:
1. Navigate to *Data map* → *Manage datasets*.
2. Click on the appropriate dataset.
3. Select the table or collection from the dropdown menu at the top of the table. 
4. Click into the field. 
5. Select the appropriate data category

### Annotating categories in a file editor

To directly annotate a dataset with data categories or configure DSR processing, you may use our _dataset editor_ or a tool of your choice. 
The dataset fields that will need to be configured are: 
* `fides_key`: the name of the dataset
* `collections`: a list of the tables or collections within the database.
* `fields`: a list of the fields within the table or collection.
* `name`: the name of the field within the table or collection.
* `data_categories`: a data category label taken from the [FidesLang Taxonomy](https://ethyca.github.io/fideslang/taxonomy/data_categories/) to describe the personal data found in this field.

The following example describes a table called `user_contact_info` within a database called `sample_dataset`. This table has the fields `id`, `email`, `first_name`, and `last name` which have been appropriately labeled for privacy request processing.

```yaml
dataset:
  - fides_key: sample_dataset
    collections:
      - name: user_contact_info
        fields:
          - name: id
            data_categories:      # Add section
              - system.operations # Provide label from taxonomy
          - name: email
            data_categories:
              - user.contact.email
          - name: first_name
            data_categories:
              - user.name
          - name: last_name
            data_categories:
              - user.name
```

### Adding an identity key
Once the dataset has been annotated with data categories, we need to provide Fides with an `identity key` to indicate which field Fides should use to search for records.

<Callout emoji="" type="info">The _identity_ key must be assigned to a field that contains unique values.</Callout>

Expanding our example above, the best field to use for the `identity key` would be the `email` field because it is unique and identifiable. 

```yaml
dataset:
  - fides_key: sample_dataset
    collections:
      - name: user_contact_info
        fields:
          - name: id
            data_categories:
              - system.operations
          - name: email
            data_categories:
              - user.contact.email
              fides_meta:        # Add section
                identity: email  # Make identity declaration
          - name: first_name
            data_categories:
              - user.name
          - name: last_name
            data_categories:
              - user.name
```

### Skipping collections
Sometimes, it will be necessary to skip over particular data collections or SaaS application endpoints. This can be useful if there's an error processing data in a particular collection or if the collection is known to not contain personal data. 

In order to skip a collection, please use the flag `skip_processing: True` as shown in this example:

```yaml
dataset:
  - fides_key: postgres_example_dataset
    name: Postgres Example Dataset
    description: Example of a Postgres dataset containing a variety of related tables like customers, products, addresses, etc.
    collections:
      - name: address
        fides_meta:
          skip_processing: True
```

In order to skip an endpoint, please use the flag `skip_processing: True` as shown in this example:

```yaml
saas_config:
  fides_key: saas_connector_example
  name: SaaS Example Config
  type: custom
  description: A sample schema representing a SaaS for Fides
  version: 0.0.1

  endpoints:
    - name: skipped_collection
      skip_processing: True
      requests:
        read:
          method: GET
          path: /v1/misc_endpoint/<list_id>
          param_values:
            - name: list_id
              references:
                - dataset: saas_connector_example
                  field: users.list_ids
                  direction: from
```
