# Data Flows: Fides Cloud vs. Self Hosted

Personal and sensitive data must be handled with the utmost care and Fides is designed to ensure this in any configuration.
This page outlines the various Fides configurations and how personal data flows and where it is stored to help you select the optimum configuration for your needs. We'll briefly review the [available Fides configurations](#comparing-fides-cloud-and-self-hosted) and then a chart of [data flow for each major feature](#data-flow-by-feature).

## Comparing Fides Cloud and Self Hosted
Fides is available in two options:

* [Fides Cloud](#fides-cloud): hosted by Ethyca in our secure, SOC2-II certified infrastructure.
* [Fides Self Hosted](#fides-self-hosted): deployed in your cloud, supported by Ethyca.


### Fides Cloud
Fides Cloud is hosted by Ethyca in our cloud infrastructure. By defaultm hosting is in the USA, with options available for organization's that require geographic data residency in Europe or other regions. Please [contact Ethyca's solutions team for more information](https://ethyca.com/book-demo).

<Callout type="info" emoji="">Fides Cloud is recommended for most organizations requiring a high degree of security and minimizing the developer resources needed for configuration and maintenance.</Callout>

In the example below you can see the typical configuration of Fides Cloud which provides options to suit your preferred connectivity solutions:

### Fides Self Hosted
Fides Self Hosted is a deployed instance of Fides, installed in your cloud and secured by your organization's firewall. Ethyca has no access to this instance and no data is stored on Ethyca infrastructure. All data processing occurs in your cloud.

<Callout type="info" emoji="">Self hosted is recommended for organizations requiring additional security controls or where you do not wish to have data stored in a third party vendor system.</Callout>

In the example below you can see the typical configuration of Fides Self Hosted, where all Fides tools are installed and configured within your cloud provider.
