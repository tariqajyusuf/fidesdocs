# Processing privacy requests
Privacy request processing is the process by which approved privacy requests are submitted to internal database or third party SaaS applications to be fulfilled. Said differently, processing is the execution of the privacy request that ensures that the legal obligation has been fulfilled.

* For [_Access_](/tutorials/privacy-requests-glossary#access-request) or [_Portability_](/tutorials/privacy-requests-glossary#portability-request) requests, Fides will send a request to the data store to return a machine-readable package containing all personal data that is found about the data subject.
* For [_Erasure_](/tutorials/privacy-requests-glossary#erasure-request) or [_Rectification_](/tutorials/privacy-requests-glossary#rectification-request) requests, Fides will send a request to the data store to erase, mask, or update all applicable personal data that is found about the data subject.

### Methods for sending requests

There are multiple methods available for sending privacy requests to database or third party SaaS vendors:

- [API requests](#using-an-api): This is the preferred way to process privacy requests and uses an interface provided by the database or third party SaaS vendor.
- [Email requests](#using-email): Email requests use a pre-configured email template to submit privacy requests the vendor using an email provided in their privacy policy. 
- [Manual requests](#using-manual-integrations): Fides can be configured to use a webhook to connect to an application and execute requests.

<Callout emoji="" type="info">Some methods have limitations on the types of privacy requests that can be supported. For example, we cannot currently support access requests over email because we can't enforce that the package returned is well-formatted or machine-readable.</Callout>

See the relevant sections below to learn more about each approach:

## API requests
This is the preferred way to process privacy requests and uses an interface provided by the database or third party SaaS vendor.

In order to configure privacy requests using an API, you will need to:
1. [Gather credentials with the appropriate permissions](#gathering-credentials).
2. [Generate & annotate a dataset to describe the data store](#generating-datasets) (if the application is a database).
3. [Configure an integration to the application or database.](#configuring-integrations)
4. [Review and update the privacy request execution policy](#managing-policies) (if desired).

### Gathering credentials
Fides uses [_Integrations_](/user-guides/integrations/) to submit privacy requests to databases and third party SaaS applications. In order to execute the appropriate queries to satisfy privacy requests against a data store, Fides will need credentials for an account with permission to perform these operations.

When you have gathered these credentials, you can proceed to [generate your dataset](#generating-datasets) if you're using a databse, or skip ahead to [configure an integration](#configuring-integrations), for SaaS connections.

### Generating datasets
A [_dataset_](/user-guides/datasets) is a configuration file that describes, to Fides, how to interact with your databases for the purpose of processing privacy requests. A dataset describes where categories of personal data (e.g. user contact info) can be found and how fields in tables or collections are related so that Fides can traverse the data to fulfill privacy requests. 

<Callout emoji="" type="info">Datasets also are required to integrate with SaaS applications. However, Fides pre-configures these datasets and they typically work out-of-the-box.</Callout>

In order to generate an actionable dataset, you will need to:

1. [Generate a dataset](/user-guides/datasets/generate-datasets) 
2. [Annotate the dataset with data categories](/user-guides/datasets/annotate-datasets#annotating-data-categories)
3. [Establish which fields contain identities](/user-guides/datasets/annotate-datasets#annotating-data-categories#adding-an-identity-key)

Once the dataset configuration complete, you can move to the next step and link the dataset to an [_Integation_](/user-guides/integrations/).

### Configuring integrations
An [_Integation_](/user-guides/integrations/) connects Fides to your databases and third-party SaaS applications, allowing Fides to execute privacy requests against all data in your organization. To learn how to configure integrations in Fides, please see our guide for [Integrating systems](/user-guides/integrations/manage-integrations).

### Managing policies
A privacy request policy is a set of rules that are executed when a _data subject_ submits a privacy request. The policy describes how Fides should return or erase data to satisfy the privacy request.

A privacy request policy consists of:
* **Rules**: these define which actions to take when a privacy request with the corresponding `action_type` is submitted
* **Rule targets**: these are the _data categories_ to which the rule applies, as annotated in the previous step.

Fides ships with two default privacy request policies: `download` (for access requests) and `delete` (for erasure requests).  

* The `download` policy is configured to retrieve `user` data and upload this data to a local storage location.
* The `delete` policy is configured to mask `user` data with the string "`MASKED`".  

To learn how to configure custom policies, please see our guide for [Configuring privacy request policies](/dev-docs/configuration/policies/request-policies).

### Configuring storage
Access requests produce a package of personal data upon completion, if data is found. This data will need to be uploaded to a storage destination (e.g. an S3 bucket) in order to be returned to the user.

To learn how to configure a storage destination, please see our guide for [Creating a storage destination](/dev-docs/configuration/privacy-requests/storage-destinations#create-a-storage-destination).

## Email requests
To configure Fides to send erasure requests via email, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the system: **Data map** → **View Systems** and choose the system that you want to integrate with. 
2. Click on the **Integrations** tab.
3. Select `Generic Erasure Email` from the drop-down menu.
4. Enter the `SaaS application name`
5. Enter the `Receipient email address` (typically _privacy@[company].com_).
6. Enter a `Test email address`, if desired. This will send a copy of the email request to the specified address.
7. Click `Save`.

<Callout emoji="" type="info">We cannot currently support access requests over email because we can't enforce that the package returned is well-formatted or machine-readable.</Callout>


## Manual requests
Manual privacy requests allow vendors to upload personal data using an API to satisfy [Access](/tutorials/privacy-requests-glossary#access-request) requests. To enable these requests, a `manual process` integration must be configured.

To configure the `manual process` [_integation_](/user-guides/integrations/):
1. Navigate to the system: **Data map** → **View Systems** and choose the system that you want to integrate with. 
2. Click on the **Integrations** tab.
3. Select `Manual process` from the drop-down menu.
4. Enter a name for the integration.
5. Click `Customize DSR`.

<Screenshot img="/assets/img/privacy-requests/manual_process.gif" description="Configure a manual connector" /> 

When an [access](/tutorials/privacy-requests-glossary#access-request) request is placed, a package containing the found personal data is returned. In order to properly format this package, you'll need to tell Fides how to label the fields of personal data in it. 

Thus, in the resulting modal, you'll need to fill in the following fields:
* `PII Field`: the label Fides will display when it solicits manual input for this field.
* `DSR Package Label`: the label Fides will use for this field in the access package that is returned to the data subject.
* `Data Categories`: the category of personal data that is returned.

### Managing policies
A privacy request policy is a set of rules that are executed when a _data subject_ [submits a privacy request](/user-guides/privacy-requests/submit-requests). The policy describes how Fides should return or erase data to satisfy the privacy request.

A privacy request policy consists of:
* **Rules** which define which actions to take when a privacy request with the corresponding `action_type` is submitted
* **Rule targets** which are the _data categories_ to which the rule applies.

Fides ships with two default privacy request policies: `download` (for access requests) and `delete` (for erasure requests).  

* The `download` policy is configured to retrieve `user` data and upload this data to a local storage location.
* The `delete` policy is configured to mask `user` data with the string "`MASKED`".  

To learn how to configure custom policies, please see our guide for [Configuring privacy request policies](/dev-docs/configuration/policies/request-policies).
