# Configuring the privacy center

<TutorialKey duration="40" product="Fides" topic="Privacy Requests" interactive="true"/>

## Introduction
In this tutorial, you will learn how to configure your privacy center to receive privacy requests, like Data Subject Requests.

## Prerequisites

For this tutorial you will need:

* A Fides Cloud or Fides Enterprise account
* The role of `Owner` or `Contributor` for your Fides organization.

## The Privacy Center

Fides provides the Privacy Center for your subjects to submit privacy requests that is typically accessed by clicking a link in the footer of your site or in your privacy policy.

This is what the privacy center for the "Cookie House" demo project looks like:

To submit a privacy request, the data subject must identify themselves using either their email address or phone number, depending on the [Privacy Center configuration](privacy-requests/receive-requests#the-privacy-center):

If [Subject Identity Verification](receive-requests#subject-identity-verification) is enabled, the data subject will receive an authentication code that they can use to confirm their identity.

Below is an example of the email received for the "Cookie House" sample project:

The subject provides the code when prompted on the privacy center to verify their identity:

And, when confirmed, the privacy request is submitted for review and processing. 

### Customizing the Privacy Center

The Privacy Center's appearance is highly configurable and these guides will show you how to customize the appearance to match your brand: 
* [Set a custom Title, Description, or Logo](../../dev-docs/configuration/privacy-requests/privacy-center#set-custom-fields)
* [Use a CSS Stylesheet](../../dev-docs/configuration/privacy-requests/privacy-center#configure-website-appearance)

To configure which privacy request functions appear in your Privacy Center, please follow our guide for [Configuring privacy request functions](../../dev-docs/configuration/privacy-requests/privacy-center#configure-privacy-request-options).

### Subject identity verification

When a privacy request is received, your organization is responsible for confirming the identity of the subject to ensure that you do not incorrectly disclose data. 

To verify an identity, you may only request information that you already have concerning a data subject. For example, you can't request a copy of a subject's drivers license if you don't already have this information.

Ethyca recommends using Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for identify verification and Fides offers built-in Subject Identity Verifiation using MFA. To learn more, please see our guide for configuring [Subject Identity Verification](../../dev-docs/configuration/privacy-requests/subject-identity-verification).
